What if we built a huge spinning ball-shaped cell in the center of the valley and threw all of the hilichurls into it? That way we might be able to generate enough energy to power all the mills in Mondstadt for at least five years. If we took it one step further by grinding the hilichurls that are too old or too weak into food and feeding them to the strong ones, we might just build ourselves a perpetual motion machine that can support a huge factory like in Snezhnaya ! It seems totally feasible to me. But when I told Miss Lisa about this idea, she just looked at me and pondered in silence for a long time, then changed the subject gracefully. Starsnatch Cliff The Anemo Archon is a bit too undisciplined for me. If I were a god, I would not have allowed my realm to look so unorganized and ragged. With enough bombs placed in proper positions, even huge cliffs like Starsnatch would crumble into dust in a second. With flatter terrain, Mondstadt would surely look much nicer. But that unctuous Cavalry Captain rejected my proposal instantly. He even asked me to stay away from Starsnatch Cliff. Windrise At the center there is a huge oak tree. It is said that Vennessa ascended there. I searched around the tree for a long time but did not find any launching device. I grabbed some hilichurls nearby to put my theory to the test. Sadly, the longest flying distance was from here to the hunters' huts around Springvale . How disappointing. Falcon Coast My unsuccessful experiment caused quite a stir in Springvale, so Miss Jean from the Knights of Favonius arranged someone to keep tabs on me. All I could do all day was to wander around at Falcon Coast. This is such a boring place. Those stupid eagles hovering in the sky and puffed-up Anemo Slimes all bored me to death! The worst of all was that I had nothing to do! On the other hand, the Outrider girl who was sent to monitor me had quite a lot of fun with the kids. Whispering Woods Yet another forest in Mondstadt. This Outrider named Amber seemed to know her way around this place. The explosive toy she carried around caught my attention. With some tweaks, I could turn it into something that could blow this forest and even the nearby mountains into smithereens easily. My proposal seemed to scare her. But an explosive stuffed toy is indeed a brilliant idea. I must try it out next time. Brightcrown Canyon I finally got rid of that stalker from the Knights of Favonius. This valley I found at the northwest coast of Cider Lake is still guarded by ancient mechanisms, but the soldiers responsible for holding the pass for the King of Gales were nowhere to be found now. All the winds of time had left behind were the unintelligent hilichurls and silent mechanical guards. &#91; Note 1 &#93; My attempt to control Ruin Guards with hilichurls failed as well. The guard split into pieces, and as for the fate of the hilichurl strapped onto it... I will spare you the gory details. Half of the ruins were also destroyed in the process. Stormterror's Lair Brightcrown Canyon leads to this huge ruin of an ancient city which was built by the cruel King of Gales, Decarabian . The city was built in a ring-shape. It seems that every resident of the city had been arranged their own spot between the inner and outer rings. Right in the center of the city was the tall tower where the King of Gales resided. The ruins of the domain of this cruel king, who once tried to control his people's lives, are now utterly deserted. I blew up a few arcades so people can climb up the tower more easily. Looks quite good to me. The ruin feels more ancient now. Vol. 2 A magazine by the Adventurers' Guild. Each issue introduces great sceneries across Teyvat. This issue includes a short traveling diary of Alice the Traveler in Liyue. —Liyue Chapter— Teyvat Geographic Special Edition xe2x80x93 Alice's Travels in Liyue Dihua Marsh The northern stretch of the Bishui River turns into a wetland. If you look south beyond the Stone Gate you will see a Silvergrass marsh as far as the eye can see. At the southernmost point of the marsh is an inn sat atop a giant rock. That is the Wangshu Inn , the highest point on the entire marsh. Look south from there and you will see the Guili Plains. You can also make out the Guyun Stone Forest across the sea. Also xe2x80x93 there's a weirdo staying at the inn on the top floor. I don't think I've ever heard him say a single word. Lunch is a true feast at the Wangshu Inn. The kitchen is equipped with every utensil you could imagine xe2x80x93 perfect for getting some practical alchemy experience. On the topic of alchemy practice, I've got a few new things to test out in my search for an explosion catalyst. If everything goes smoothly, I'll spend a few more days here then head to the Guili Plains. Guili Plains In the end, I came to the Guili Plains a few days earlier than I'd originally planned. Records suggest that prior to the Archon War, this area was a thriving marketplace. The foxes and wild finches are stunning here, their fur and feathers have a certain glow about them. But I hear that they can be pests, too. Liyue locals complain that they keep eating their fruit offerings to the Geo Archon. I wonder if that gives them a fruity aroma when roasted? Maybe I should go hunting. They run a strict operation at the checkpoint on the main road, but the guards who work there are friendly people. I made a potion from some local herbs and gave it to one of them for his stutter xe2x80x93 it cured him, but it did have some minor side effects. He now can't help but constantly imitate everyone he comes across. Not just what they say, but the way they say it. It's uncanny how spot-on his impressions are. Jueyun Karst I'm told that somewhere amidst the misty peaks of Jueyun Karst lives an adeptus, the exact location hidden somewhere in the ocean of cloud. All the Liyue herb gatherers claim to have seen the realm of the adepti in all its glory revealed before their very eyes in the clouds. Based on personal experience, I can say that over-indulging on certain types of mushrooms can induce visions of a similar nature. The terrain here fascinates me. So many of these Stone Pillars look like they belong deep underground, not here on top of a mountain. There is supposed to be an underground reservoir here. Part of me wonders if all the water was drawn out, perhaps Jueyun Karst would find itself back on the ocean floor where it belongs. My travel companion Zhongli is the sternest person I know, but he seems most entertained by this theory. He won't stop laughing. What an odd fellow. Yaoguang Shoal I've heard that the fog often rolls in off the sea onto Yaoguang Shoal, and when it's at its thickest you can barely see your hand at the end of your outstretched arm. Unfortunately, I didn't make it here in time to see a foggy episode. It's a bit of a shame. There are so many lovely shells on the beach. I wonder how many of them have been there since the Archon War? I strung some of them together to make a necklace, but unfortunately that fisherman from the inn sat on it and broke it... Every last shell, brutally crushed beneath his merciless buttocks. None were spared. Not only that, but because he injured himself on the shards of broken shell, I had to pay his medical bills. A giant sea-snail shell stands on the beach where the Bishui River enters the sea. A kind old lady lives inside. Her family is said to have sailed here on the giant shell, and she spends her time rescuing shipwrecked people who end up drifting near the shore. I think that repurposing the giant shell as a self-propelled boat would make it much easier for her to rescue people from the sea. But after I lost control of my third prototype seashell-boat and it blew up, the kind old lady decided she was not going to rescue me from the sea anymore. Guyun Stone Forest This is the site where the Geo Archon defeated the sea monster. Some of the great stone Poles that pierce the ocean floor still tower above the surface of the sea, though many snapped long ago. The hexagonal Stone Pillars, formed from a conglomeration of Geo energy, are quite intriguing to look at. Viewed from above, one gets the impression that they were deliberately arranged in their current form to make a specific shape on the ocean surface. Maybe that was the real reason the Geo Archon rained down destruction on the ocean floor with his stone Poles? Maybe it was all just a big joke, albeit in extremely poor taste? Zhongli from Liyue Harbor seems extremely knowledgeable on Liyue folklore, but I've never actually seen him come here. I can see the Wangshu Inn in the distance. I'll bet that weirdo I met there last time is still staring this way now. The flow of the ley lines around here are unique in all of Liyue. Much more dynamic, somewhat unstable... It's as if a great, relentless power stirs somewhere in the depths of the ocean. Perhaps it is the defeated sea monster , still writhing on the ocean floor. Vol. 3 A magazine by the Adventurers' Guild. Each issue introduces great sceneries across Teyvat. This issue includes a short traveling diary of Alice the Traveler in Inazuma. —Inazuma Chapter— Teyvat Geographic Special Edition — Alice's Inazuma Diaries Mt. Yougou Lush sakura trees grow all over this mountain on the northern end of Narukami Island . These sakura all share roots with the largest of them, the Sacred Sakura , which sits on the mountain's summit. The Grand Narukami Shrine , greatest of the Inazuman shrines, is dedicated to this Sacred Sakura. Little Yae has been the one managing the shrine in recent years. Ah, how she's grown! It's just a shame, really, to think that I can never again make her cry as easily as I used to. Really, I'd thought that she'd quickly get drunk, start to cry, and start talking all silly, but she drank me under the table instead... I made a fool of myself in the process and was quite thoroughly mocked for it. Getting made out to be some old woman who got what was coming to her... Bah. ...And here I was looking to tease that little girl a bit more, too. Inazuma City I brought a new firework formula to that Naganohara kid 's place. But when he heard me talking about a new medicine that might cure his deafness, he demurred and did not accept it. This kid is ever the conservative about explosives, always diluting them to the point where they cannot cause any obvious physical changes to the environment, and always relying on the combustion of different metals to produce monotonous visual effects. And he only does tests inside his workshop! I mean, come on, where's the fun in that? Ah, such a waste, such a waste! Now as for his daughter, Yoimiya , she's an interesting young lady. We collected a lot of sweets during the festival and tried all kinds of new formulae out. That was so much fun! ...And then we got packed off to a deserted beach by the fire brigade. Something about new rules with which to keep the peace in Inazuma City, or something similarly silly. We discussed a lot of new ideas, and she even gave me some constructive feedback. A talented kid, this one is. If the paradise I made for Klee also had one of Yoimiya's fireworks performances, that would have been perfect! It's just a shame that that grumpy general &#91; Note 2 &#93; kept too close an eye on us — or else I'd have helped Yoimiya improve some of her gadgets, or even spirited her away. This reminds me of the time, not long ago, when I was preparing a medicine that would allow for flight in the Imperial Kitchen. It blew up due to a mistake of mine, injuring a young tengu warrior to the point where her left wing would have needed, say, half a month to recover. I had wanted to help her patch the wound up, but it seems as if she's been avoiding me ever since... Well, I left her some medicine all the same, just to see how its effects would turn out. After that incident, it seems that person who spends all her time holed up in Tenshukaku has sent some soldiers specifically to watch my every move. I mean, that's a bit much. I even apologized right to her face, but she just won't let up. She was the one who'd allowed me to conduct experiments in the Imperial Kitchen in the first place, you know? Also, Ms. Kamisato declined my idol group invitation for the sixth time running. Ah, what a disappointment. Tatarasuna Tatarasuna is an island chain that is naturally shaped like a ring. The mountains rise to overlook the sea, surrounding the large blast furnace in the middle. This is where Inazuman Jade Steel is produced and endlessly made into the best weaponry for the highfalutin bigwigs of Inazuma — ore made from the blood and bones of a defeated god . This place is the Tenryou Commissioner 's pride and joy, and as such, he takes extra good care of the workers and technical specialists. I was accompanied during my time at Tatarasuna by a lady named Kagami Gozen . She seems to be a leader amongst the workers there, and has an official Shogunate post. Even though she's the Tenryou Commissioner's subordinate, she very much looks like his equal in front of the workers. All of them trust and love her. I'd daresay that their respect for her dispatches might be even greater than what they give the Shogun... But Kagami Gozen herself frowns often. Very unfriendly-looking. The Tatarasuna workers are largely rootless, washed up on these shores by the waves of history. Their many tattoos and working songs set them apart, but also strengthen their mutual bonds. Like the other workers at Tatarasuna, Kagami Gozen's body has scars from high-temperature burns from Tatarigami . These may be signs of short-lived or ill people in the eyes of outsiders, but here, it is how they identify family. I took the liberty of modifying the Mikage Furnace , throwing a few valves and panels into the sea and improving the containment dome, which back then could, at best, be rated "better than nothing." I wonder if those engineers from Fontaine will be pleasantly surprised? Old man Kujou might get a little upset from production going down, but at least the furnace isn't going to go haywire from overheating, and I believe that even in the event of a war, which may soon come, the explosion should not be too large."Large" according to my personal standards, of course. Hmm, actually, might my ingenious interventions perhaps prevent war from breaking out at all?Well, I for one would be more than pleased to see the expressions on those astrologers' faces when their predictions come to naught! Hah! Yashiori Island Ah, the clear blue skies over Yashiori Island really are a pleasant sight. Those stodgy onmyouji explained that the Raiden Shogun placed many "wards" over this place to prevent the corruption that seeps from the remnants of the serpent god... or something like that. I'm not good with their religious jargon. As far as I can observe, those lamp posts are quite interesting. Although they have the appearance of items dedicated to the Electro Archon, the techniques used to make them are quite familiar to me. Oh, whoa, would you look at that! This is supposed to be a travelogue, not some tedious academic paper! We were warmly welcomed by Washizu , the head of Higi Village . The grilled fish and onigiri were great! Also, that place they call Nazuchi Beach is full of friendly pirates... Ah, it's just a shame that I couldn't stay on this island for longer. The mines on the island are busy places indeed, but the equipment they use there is quite backward. Even though the Shogun put all those wards down, blocking off most of the Tatarigami's spread, many miners have still contracted chronic illnesses from prolonged exposure to the influence of those snake-bone crystals. The Sakura Mochi that the onmyouji brought with them are very tasty, but they're hardly the equal of the beauties that Little Yae makes. I should probably pay a visit to Asase Shrine later. I wonder how that fat cat 's been doing lately... I did try to catch it with a specially-crafted cage the other time, only to be stopped by that killjoy shrine maiden .A long-standing Natlan folk tale that was originally told orally. As such, there is now no way of knowing who the original author was. Long, long ago, that dim star was as bright as all the other stars you now see, yet the lives of the tribespeople were much the same as they are in the present day. To you, this way of life may seem overly familiar, perhaps nothing special, even lacking in excitement; but for Qoyllor, who lived on that star, it was anything but ordinary... Though the star that Qoyllor lived on was the one that was closest to the tribes , yet still she was inestimably far away from her brothers and sisters. Like you, she was always full of curiosity for things she didn't understand. Just as we who live on the ground gaze up in awe at the starry sky, she too would often look down with great interest upon the tribes on the ground. But one day, Qoyllor leaned too far forward and accidentally fell from the sky. Falling to the ground, the star lost its former brilliance, and her power shattered into fragments that were scattered across the land. Her father, the Sun, had entrusted her with this power, exhorting her to guard it carefully — but now, without that power, she could never again return to the sky! Qoyllor reflected upon how, when she was simply observing it from the star, life on the ground had seemed so fascinating to her; yet now that she had to give up her original life and became a part of it, it all seemed far less satisfying... For a long time, Qoyllor wandered alone, facing many dangers, for the wilderness back then was far more perilous than it is now. Yet despite her tribulations, she found nothing. Later, by utter chance, she met Ukuku, a hunter from the tribe , and things began to change. Ukuku was a fierce warrior, as strong and silent as a bear. Upon learning of Qoyllor's plight, he agreed to help her search for the scattered shards of her star, then send her back home. He prided himself on his skills as a hunter — both his prowess in the chase, and of course, his mastery of the art of tracking too. So side by side, they set off on their roamings. They climbed high mountains and scaled great peaks, ventured into deep ravines and gloomy caverns; and in the process, defeated hordes of enemies and made scores of friends. Under Ukuku's watchful guidance, Qoyllor grew accustomed to life on the ground. Just like you and me — perhaps even better than some of us — she hunted, fought, and rested with Saurians , recounted the incredible stories she had heard from the mouths of the storytellers to the children of the tribe, ate Tatacos , and chased after the Monetoo ... Yet occasionally, on those nights back then unlit by glowing graffiti, the stars in the night sky would suddenly remind her of her distant home. Now, she was even further from her brothers and sisters... Did they miss her too? ... After years of fruitless searching, Qoyllor began to wonder — perhaps, in the same way that she had become a part of the tribe, her lost power had long since been found. Perhaps the birds, beasts, insects, and snakes had claimed it for their own? When she asked Ukuku if he had grown tired of chasing such an elusive goal, the only answer he gave was a short "Sorry." "What a tongue-tied hunter!" she thought to herself. "Yet his heart is kind." Besides, they had been searching blindly from the very start, and it was by any reckoning a difficult task — and besides, it really had nothing to do with Ukuku from the first, so his apology was utterly misplaced. Thinking back on how this quiet hunter had taken such good care of her, Qoyllor could only marvel at his kindness... Later on, Qoyllor and Ukuku were to form a family together, settling down in a corner of the tribe. And to think, the young children of the tribe had not the slightest inkling that one of their neighbors had fallen from the stars! Qoyllor had always been of a cheerful disposition, and when things happened that could not be helped, she simply let them be. Though her homeland was now far out of reach, the twinkling stars seemed to greet her as if they were her brothers and sisters themselves, and so she was content. But Ukuku, whose wish had seemingly come true, became even more silent and gloomy than before. Some said it was just his nature, while others speculated that he was haunted by guilt as a result of having failed to fulfill his promise to Qoyllor... Such theories each have their merits, but as you know, when someone harbors an unspeakable secret, they tend to appear melancholy, and this was certainly the case with Ukuku. But what exactly was this secret that Ukuku was hiding? Forgive me, I must keep you in suspense for now, and instead return to the matter of neighbors. It is said that a relative far off is less helpful than a neighbor close by, and in the tribe, we always rely on the support of our neighbors and friends. As bad luck would have it, their neighbor Pochica was a troublemaker who had never gotten along with Ukuku. He had always tried to make things difficult for Ukuku, but as long as Ukuku ignored him, things never escalated — so before Qoyllor's arrival, they managed to coexist. But Qoyllor's presence ignited a spark of jealousy in Pochica, and once that spark was lit, it could not be so easily extinguished. "Ukuku is a kind person, and kind people always put the needs of others above their own." Of course, Pochica was well aware of what the other tribespeople thought of Ukuku, but he clearly saw things differently. "What a bore he is, a complete and utter bore! But I can use his 'kindness' against him, and in the end, it will save me much trouble." Pochica's plan was very simple: he would, from time to time, speak badly of Ukuku in front of Qoyllor, adding a bit of "color" here and there, embellishing his stories with malicious barbs. You might wonder how such a clumsy trick could work, but do not forget — the extreme reticence, even gloominess, that Ukuku had shown of late could be hard to bear for someone whose origins were as special as Qoyllor's... "Ah, look at you, like a bird that has had its wings clipped." When he was talking to Qoyllor, Pochica always took on an air of intimacy. "He's always been like this. Whenever he found a bird he liked, he'd clip its wings to stop it from flying away, then lock it in a cage. Pitiful, truly pitiful!" At first, Qoyllor paid no attention to her vindictive neighbor's gossip, but after years of hearing it time and time again, she could not help but begin to have doubts. She longed to know what was in Ukuku's heart, but neither did she want to make a big deal out of nothing, so she tried probing with a few comments disguised as playful remarks. Yet always Ukuku seemed unwilling to engage, either dodging her questions or simply adopting his usual gloomy demeanor and answering only with heavy silence. Now, let us return to the secret that Ukuku had kept hidden within his heart. Everything he did only served to deepen Qoyllor's suspicions, and she was the type that liked to get to the bottom of things — after all, if it wasn't for that, she would never have fallen from her star in the first place. Under the pressure of her questioning, Ukuku soon confessed his secret. It turned out that in the course of their past travels together, he had indeed found some star shards. In other words, the goal that had always seemed so elusive to Qoyllor was not entirely without its clues. But by that time, Ukuku had already developed feelings for her, and he knew that when the day came when all the shards had been found, Qoyllor would return to the stars, and they would never see one another again... As I see it, it is hard for anyone to persist in something that goes against their nature for long, and Ukuku was no exception to this rule. When he finally revealed his innermost secret, it was as if a heavy weight had been lifted from his shoulders, and even the gloom on his face seemed to lessen. Yet having heard his confession, Qoyllor felt only sadness and anger — deceit and betrayal were things she had never before known, but now she understood their bitter pang. She really was a bird whose wings had been clipped! Thinking such a thought only served to convince Qoyllor that Ukuku's actions could not be forgiven. And as we all know, though it takes great time to build, deep trust can be destroyed in an instant. Qoyllor demanded that Ukuku hand over the star shards he had hidden, but Ukuku refused. He could not bear the thought of parting with her, still believing that as long as he kept her close, there was always a chance that he might turn things around. But this was a vain idea — for as we all have our limits when it comes to forgiveness, and these vary from person to person, so for Qoyllor did the buck stop at deceit and betrayal. Ignoring his pleas, Qoyllor left the tribe she had once considered home, returning to the same wilderness she had wandered when she first fell down to the ground. But this time it was different — she knew what she had to do. Like a true person of Natlan , she left a huge work of graffiti on the vast expanse of land. How big was it? Though it can now be seen no longer, it is said that those who witnessed it at the time remarked that it might well have been bigger than a volcano! You could not have missed such a gigantic piece of graffiti, even if you were gazing down from the Sun itself. And indeed, that was her intention. Let her lost power be, she thought to herself. Whether hidden by Ukuku, or claimed by the birds, beasts, insects, and snakes, it mattered not — for she could always turn to her father, the one who had bestowed this power upon her in the first place, and was willing to accept any punishment that might come her way. And lo! Qoyllor's Sun-father saw her plea, quickly bringing her back to the sky. That star that had lost its power became dim, and was now almost invisible unless you looked very closely. Would Qoyllor still look down at the land, observing the lives of the people below as she once did? I do not know the answer to that, but what is certain is that she was reunited with her many brothers and sisters, returned to a place that even the mightiest Iktomisaurus could not reach. As for Ukuku, who had been left behind, his deceit and betrayal angered the Sun. As punishment, he was blinded by the Sun's golden arrows. From then on, wherever he went, the Sun would retreat behind the clouds, leaving him without a trace of sunlight. Even their child Kuntur , who was still very young at the time, was affected by this. As a result, he was unable to form a single friendship with any Saurian until he had grown up to be a young man. But as for Kuntur's adventures thereafter... Well, that is another story entirely.After Qoyllor had returned to the skies, Ukuku , blinded by the sun's golden arrows, remained within the tribe , raising the still-young Kuntur alone. All within the tribe knew why this had happened, and though they did not banish father and son — who had naught save each other to depend on — from their midst, they still feared and shunned them. Kuntur, who then could not even speak, became dragged into all this. Like his taciturn father, wheresoever he trod, the sun would retreat behind a thick layer of clouds, depriving the world of its light. Who, then, could say if the sun's ire would not also fall upon those close to them? None of the tribespeople dared to brave such misfortune. Kuntur grew all the same, unloved though he was by the sun. But just as the fruits in front of his house were smaller by far than his neighbors, he was a weak specimen compared to other youths his age. This poor child never knew the touch of the warm sun upon his skin, so he was sickly pale as opposed to ruddy as his peers were. But his eyes shone like the stars, just like his mother's. It was those bright, starry eyes that had first drawn his father in, that had driven him to make his foolish decisions, bringing judgment upon himself. "Could any Iktomisaurus not like basking in the sun?" Kuntur asked Ukuku one day. Ukuku did not reply, and merely whittled his arrows in silence — though blind, he was a fine hunter still. It was only natural for Kuntur to ask such questions, for in those days, which child of the tribe was not inseparably bound to their Saurian companion? Kuntur thus wished for a companion of his own, but it was evident that no Iktomisaurus would willingly live in the shadows. Though they may be more active at night, we now know that they would never assent to being utterly deprived of sunlight. Kuntur searched long and hard, but he could not find an Iktomisaurus who loved not the sun to be his companion. As for Ukuku, his father and sole support, he only cared for hunting and feeding his son, giving no thought to Saurian companionship. This was little wonder, for Ukuku's own companion had chosen to be Qoyllor's helper when she left the tribe, returning to the wilds with her. Ukuku had grown used to being without such a companion, just as he was now used to having neither sight nor sunlight. He even thought that Kuntur might also grow accustomed to this and cease asking, and so remained silent in response. Fortunately, Kuntur was only half alike to his father, or the story would have ended here. He was never the sort to take things lying down — and he was certainly not going to let people make him a laughingstock for failing to find an Iktomisaurus companion. All those children who mocked him received their due reply, albeit with fists rather than words. In the beginning, he always lost, which was quite understandable. He was small, and his fists lacked strength. And as they watched him sit on the ground, dust and dirt caking his face, the children who laughed at him laughed all the harder. But slowly, they no longer did so, nor did jokes at his expense come so freely from their lips. For they found that Kuntur learned quickly, and his strength surged in pursuit of theirs, such that his fists were persuasive indeed, even in the absence of a Saurian companion. But Kuntur was not satisfied with merely reducing loud mockery into low murmuring. He knew now that strength could at least force half-grown children to give the appearance of acquiescence, but he still lacked a Saurian companion of his own and remained unloved by the sun. Though many adults in the tribe were neither hostile nor friendly toward him, he did not like the looks in their eyes. And so, Kuntur decided to do something remarkable to prove himself. If he did that, no one would ever look down on him again, and surely, there would be a Saurian willing to be his companion. His chance came soon. One day, an old man in ragged clothing came to the tribe, asking for water. The people took pity on him, and one of them invited them into their home: "We are all kind-hearted people here. You must have come from a faraway place, dear guest, so stay and enjoy our hospitality." "Indeed, you are all kind people. In that case, treat me to the best you have, I'm starving over here!"The master of the house did indeed provide the best food to the guest, but seven days and seven nights later, the guest was still not satiated. "Is there anything else? Well, is there? Now, now, don't be shy, serve it all up!" The master of the house would kindly ask the guest to leave, though not because he had nothing left to be eaten, but because he needed to consider his family and himself. "I have put him up and had him fed and feasted for seven days, proving my kindness of heart. Now, it is someone else's turn." Kindness is a pleasant word, especially when used to describe oneself. And so, the tribespeople gave this ragged old man all manner of things, but none could satisfy his bottomless desire. In the end, all could do nothing but shake their heads, wave their hands, and ask him to depart. Only Kuntur's house did not entertain the old man. "You are a kind soul, too. So, what will you host me with?" "Hah! No one has ever called me 'kind.' I have nothing to share with you, and even if I had, I shan't give you any. You've eaten, drank, and taken more than enough." Seeing how Kuntur chased the old man away, many in the tribe could not help but ridicule him again. But none could have anticipated that this old fellow dressed in tatters was the infamous sorcerer Rumi in disguise! Those who had promised him hospitality yet who could not satisfy his appetites, he bewitched with his dark arts, and by the time they awoke from their nightmares, he had long since captured all their Saurians, leading them away! Many in the tribe had already heard the terrible rumors concerning Rumi, and while none could say what terrible scheme he meant to carry out with their Saurians, all knew that failing to stop him would bode ill. To seize their Saurians back, the tribe sent forth their three mightiest warriors to challenge him, but they did not return."Even the best warrior is no match for the sorcerer Rumi without Saurian aid..." And just as the tribe had lost their confidence, Kuntur stepped forth to volunteer himself. Yes, him! "Kuntur, Unloved of the Sun"! One who had never even gained a Saurian companion! Now, none believed he would succeed, but neither did any bar his path. "Good thing I've nothing to lose. At least he cannot take from me what l never had." Thus thinking, Kuntur set out on his journey with great confidence. As Kuntur made his way forward, Rumi's spells summoned up layers of mist to surround the warrior. He knew that Kuntur was hated by the sun, and so, could count on no sunbeams to scatter the mist for him and light the way.But Kuntur had learned the hunting arts from his blind father since he was a boy. Though he was as good as blind, sounds and smells guided the way for him, and the magically manifested mists could not snare him. One ploy having failed, the sorcerer Rumi deployed another, sending forth three talking Pakpakas to come before Kuntur with both threats and temptations. These three Pakpakas were the three warriors the tribe sent forth, who had each been defeated due to their own weaknesses and turned into this form by Rumi. They did not believe "Kuntur, Unloved of the Sun" to be superior to them, and so they spoke the very deceptions Rumi had snared them with, attempting to trick Kuntur. But Kuntur would not fall for such trickery. His father had been punished for deceit and betrayal, and so he hated all lies most bitterly, and could always see through them at a glance. Having had their ruse exposed, the warriors were enraged and tried to block Kuntur's path, upon which he had no choice but to persuade them to step aside by force. Thus did Kuntur pass through numerous trials until he finally found the sorcerer Rumi, and also laid eyes upon the captured Saurians. The sorcerer put his evil arts to use once more, attempting to frighten Kuntur. But even towering waves and running lava could not scare Kuntur, much less these illusory traps made through spellcraft, so akin to the fog he had encountered at the bottom of the valley earlier. His wicked spells had no effect on Kuntur, but the captured Saurians were not similarly immune, and so Rumi used his spellcraft to turn them to his service. Yet, he did not expect even them to not be a match for Kuntur."Your fists are tougher than the hardest stones I've ever seen!" No one would want to go hand-to-hand against such fists, and Rumi was no different. Realizing that he was on the back foot, he no longer cared for the Saurians he had stolen from the tribe. Turning into a cloud of smoke, he fled in defeat. Capable though Kuntur was of discerning the sorcerer's traps and lies, he could do nothing against his foe now that he had turned into smoke. But how could he back down? He intended to prove himself to everyone in the tribe by doing this extraordinary thing. And so, he made up his mind to capture Rumi, no matter what it took or what he had to do.At that moment, he saw the still-bound Iktomisaurs, and he thought, since Rumi had been able to command them using mystical arts, perhaps he might use force to compel an Iktomisaurus to help him track Rumi's down and pick out his manifestation. The poor creatures were still under the influence of the spell as he unshackled them, and so they struggled and screamed. It took Kuntur a lot of effort to calm them down. And as to which was the bravest of the lot, Kuntur had recognized it at a glance. "Alright. Now then, you're coming with me, and we're going to track down Rumi the sorcerer — for my honor... Uh, and also for the warriors who were turned into Pakpakas." The Iktomisaurus seemed unconvinced and tried to break free, but Kuntur held it fast, and it could not move. Yet, looking into the creature's sad eyes made even fearless Kuntur shudder. Of course, he could tame the Saurian this way, but were he to do so, how different would he be from the wicked sorcerer? So, after only a moment's hesitation, he made up his mind. "Fly, then! Go where you please." The Iktomisaurus spread its wings and flew off the moment Kuntur let go, swiftly disappearing over the horizon. And so Kuntur went in pursuit of Rumi alone. The released Saurians could not speak human language, of course, and glory unwitnessed is no glory at all. Thus was Kuntur's first step on his journey to prove himself also his most anxious one: For Rumi had long transformed into smoke, drifting far away to places unknown.He had also heard the rumors that the tribe's storytellers and well-informed messengers had brought of Rumi, and guessing that he might turn into an animal to avoid pursuit, he wrestled Long-Necked Rhinos and stared down grasshoppers all along his path, but to no avail. It seemed that without an Ikotmisaurus companion's aid, the search for the sorcerer would be like searching for a needle in a haystack. But Kuntur had inherited more than just star-like eyes from Qoyllor, and just as his mother had once wandered the wilderness, searching tirelessly for star-shard traces, Kuntur too did not despair of the chase for Rumi, and the confidence he had set out from the tribe with never dimmed. Until the day he heard a familiar cry. It was that of an Iktomisaurus he recognized. Indeed, it was the one he'd released, the boldest in the tribe, one who also lacked a companion. It had left him, but now, it had returned. We do not know why it did so, but we can be sure that Iktomisaurs are most intelligent creatures who choose their partners. Surely, then, Kuntur had earned its recognition, which is why it returned and willingly showed Kuntur the way. With the aid of an Iktomisaurus, even the wily Rumi was no match. The sorcerer even attempted to take a Brown Deer 's form to escape Kuntur, only to find that the hunter was just as swift as he. On the brink of being caught, Rumi transformed into a capybara and dived into the water. How secretly pleased he was with himself then, for he thought that Kuntur might not be a good swimmer. Surely, he would escape! Yet Kuntur's Ikotmisaurus companion was not merely brave, but blessed with wisdom as well. It flapped its wings in the air, summoning forth a cyclone. Kuntur rode that wind, and his footsteps grew swift and light, as if his feet had grown wings — giving him speed no less than that of Rumi, now a fast-swimming capybara. Shocked, Rumi leapt out of the water, transforming into a bird that immediately made for the skies above... Which wasn't a good move, if you ask me. If this had been the Kuntur of yesterday, he would have had no choice but to give up, but today, things were different. His Iktomisaurus companion carried him up and up through the clouds, and at last, they caught the cunning sorcerer. Realizing that there was no way out, Rumi simply turned himself into a giant rock. Surely, Kuntur could do nothing about him now! Yet the young warrior grabbed the giant rock and would not let go, crying, "Fly! Higher, my friend, higher!" And so higher and higher they flew, until they soared above the very highest cloud layer, and there, Kuntur beheld the sun for the first time. But before he could say anything, the sun brought forth cloud layers, more and thicker, to surround them. Kuntur and his companion had no choice but to try to find a way out, bursting through the thunder, rain, and storm in the cloud layers as they went. The great heights were frigid indeed, with even Kuntur's eyelids swathed in frost, while the rock that Rumi had transformed into was frozen solid — never again would his foul magic wreak havoc. Having overcome trial after trial, Kuntur and his companion returned to the tribe, telling everyone about their marvelous experience. After that, the stone that Rumi had turned into was placed in a suitable location. The three warriors who had been turned into Pakpakas by the sorcerer were themselves restored to human form. As before, they gave Kuntur a wide berth, but out of shame and regret rather than disgust and fear, for had they not thought then to use despicable lies to trick him? Thus did Kuntur prove himself to his tribe and win glory. But more importantly to him, he finally had an Iktomisaurus companion of his own!

the age of depression and tyranny, the outlander girl met the ominous orphan. Does this fateful encounter foretell a tragic ending? The historic romance novel, The Mondstadt Tower, begins! In the time of the aristocrats, there stood a high tower in Mondstadt's plaza. It was built to honor Barbatos the Anemo Archon in name, yet in reality it was nothing more than a flamboyant display of wealth and power by the royal to gloat over the commoners. The one time in the year that the commoners living in these dark times could find a little solace was during Ludi Harpastum . During one Ludi Harpastum, a wandering singer from a distant land arrived in the city. The name of the lass was Inxc3xa8s, and everyone at the festival was enchanted by her stunning beauty. People of all ages and all walks of life vied to catch a glimpse of her throwing the Harpastum and to hear her sing foreign ballads. "The blessings of Barbatos are for everyone! You are only sinful if you are bitter at such a joyous occasion!" As she sang these verses, she handed out her earnings during the festival to the poor and orphans in the city. A frail figure stood amongst the crowds. He was the Seneschal, and he fell for her at first sight. But his religious piety filled him with a frustration at his inability to suppress the emotions he was experiencing, and her acts of charity, which violated the Church's right to aid to the poor, irked him all the more. As is known to all, the beliefs of contemporary Mondstadters hold that the Anemo Archon Barbatos encourages people to seek love and pursue freedom, but in the dark ages the Anemo Archon slept, and the city of tormented by the tyranny of the nobles, the poverty of the commoners, and the ravage of the dragon ; meanwhile, the self-proclaimed "orthodox" church — a mere figurehead, controlled by the ruling class — advocated abstinence from earthly pleasure to avert divine punishment. Under such circumstances, even the harp which symbolized the wind had been restricted to playing only those songs deemed "holy." However, the notion of "divine punishment" was little more than an excuse fabricated by the nobles to conceal their avarice and restrict the commoners. "To let her stay in the city is to bewitch all its inhabitants. What wickedness will this witch bring?" The Seneschal pondered. And so, the Seneschal plotted to hunt down Inxc3xa8s, and to confine her to the Cathedral while awaiting further instructions. As per the traditions of the time, the maiden chosen to throw the Harpastum should serve at the royal court for three days after the celebration, under the protection of the aristocrats. The Seneschal decided to send his adopted son, Octave, to sneak into the royal court and abduct Inxc3xa8s. Octave was an unwelcome child, abandoned by his superstitious parents at birth and later raised by the Seneschal. As a child, he was persecuted and abused by the citizens, seen as a bad omen of draconic disasters. The only person who protected Octave was the Seneschal, who treated him like his own son and thus won his utmost trust. "Bring the maiden who threw the Harpastum yesterday to me! Disturb no one and do not mention my name." Under orders from the Seneschal, Octave climbed onto the balcony of the court chambers at nightfall. Upon seeing the girl weeping in the moonlight, his pure heart was stirred, for he had never seen such a wondrous sight. He gazed at the girl, leaving his task forgotten. But the silence of the tranquil moment shared by Octave and the girl was interrupted by the servants...A Hilichurlian poem created by Ella Musk .

It tells the story of Vennessa , the founder of the Knights of Favonius , in her early years as a slave in Mondstadt. Friends of Mondstadt, let us revel! Drink to your hearts' content! To freedom! To the Anemo Archon ! To Vennessa, the first Knight to grace this world! Sons and daughters of Mondstadt, may the gift from the Anemo Archon be engraved in your hearts! And let it be known that this gift is not freedom, but just defiance! It transpired in ages past. Friends, do excuse me for improvising, For it should be clear as day, that the glory and freedom of Mondstadt Were born when Barbatos struck the strings dolce. Poems sing of heroic fame, Yet to commemorate unnamed freedom should they aim. Chained by royals, Mondstadt could barely suspire, And festivities were but vanity games of the rich, Beyond the grasp of the ordinary people. A withering dungeon, Mondstadt was. In slavery games the royal gaily relished, Oblivious to their place, the inmates were. A fiery-headed dame confined to a cell, From the southern plains she did hail. Born free but now bound by chains, Though restrained by a tyrant her flesh remained. Still her pious soul never ceased to pray, For her people, for Mondstadt, for illusive freedom if she may. Vol. 2 A popular song since the reconstruction of Mondstadt. It tells the story of Vennessa, the founder of the Knights of Favonius, in her early years when she met Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, as well as how she defeated the drake and overthrew the Aristocrats. Friends of Mondstadt, let us revel! Drink to your hearts' content! The day came when Barbatos answered her devotion. The Anemo Archon sought her fiery hair and descended to her position. "Every being deserves a name," the spirit grinned. "To weave your fair name into a song I yearn," "I seek nothing but your friendship in return." The girl happily reciprocated, her fears swiftly dissipated. And so, to the battlefield she marched to Barbatos' singing voice, The demonic dragon fled from her might and the people did rejoice. Corpulent aristocrats crawled under tables at such a valiant sight. "Mondstadt is freedom," the winds sang for their people in delight. Lonely forest breezes converged, jointly they overthrew the tyrant's tower from the sky. Broken free from shackles at last, the young lioness stood firm in the winds with her head held high. And so, the fiery-headed dame won herself prestigious fame. Her heart swelled with appreciation to sing by the Anemo Archon's side. But no words of gratitude should she utter, Barbatos replied: "You first conducted what now transpires in your song." "You have entrusted me with your friendship and your name." "To praise your freedom, my songs came." Friends, let us drink some more! For thence flows the freedom of Mondstadt. When days become nights and faces fill with despair, Never forget the heroic tales of Vennessa, the dame with the flaming hair! Never cease to pursue freedom, even when the land is bare!

masterpiece of the Poet Laureate of Hilichurlian ! Scholar Jacob Musk will show you the mysterious spiritual world of the hilichurls through this poetry collection! A collection of hilichurl poetry compiled by the Mondstadt ecologist Jacob Musk. During the writing of this book, Musk traveled across the continent to visit every hilichurl tribe, even going so far as to venture deep into hilichurl settlements and become intimately acquainted with their lives. Musk was praised as the "Poet Laureate of Hilichurlian" for this book, but it is evident that neither the scholar himself nor the hilichurls were particularly fond of this honor. Jacob Musk, though enthusiastic about hilichurl studies, loathed to be associated with them even in his late years. The first song: Mi muhe ye Mi biat ye Biat ye dada Muhe dada Quite possibly a battle song sung by the hilichurls before combat. I have observed that when two or more hilichurls are present, they engage in frenzied brawling after singing this vulgar song. &#91; Note 1 &#93; The second song: Eleka mimi-a-Domu Mita domu-a-dada La-la-la La-la-la Mimi mosi ye mita The song is sung by hilichurls as they dance around totem poles. In my estimation it is some form of tribal hymn. It has an upbeat tone and is usually heard during festivals. The third song: Mi muhe mita nye Mi muhe mita nye Muhe nye Muhe nye Gusha Biat, gusha A melancholic hilichurl song I heard during an exchange with an elderly samachurl. Although I do not yet understand the literal meaning of the poem, the overwhelming sense of grief that comes through in the song is enough to captivate the best poets in my birthplace (despite such praise, I must admit the acrid smells coming from the elderly hilichurls were just as melancholic, and just as overwhelming). Vol. 2 Are wine and poetry a part of the hilichurl lifestyle? Do they have pure and devout desires? Expert on the hilichurls, Jacob Musk, is here to answer! The fourth song: Celi upa celi Sada shato lata Kuzi unu ya zido Unu dada A song sung by Samachurls . Judging by the reaction of the chief, the song seems to bear a special philosophical meaning for the hilichurls. It may appear ridiculous in the mainstream academic circles, and I have no intention of casting doubt upon well-established views, but I feel obliged to say that the question of whether philosophical discourse truly exists among the Hilichurls is one that still fascinates me to this day, and may be deserving of further study. The fifth song: Nini movo muhe yoyo Nini movo mimi tomo Lata movo mosi yoyo Celi movo celi yoyo Much like the people of Mondstadt, the wind-worshiping hilichurl tribes often drink to excess and sing endless songs of praise to the Anemo Archon . &#91; Note 2 &#93; This is a hilichurl ode that is often heard when they are inebriated. &#91; Note 3 &#93; The sixth song: Unu, unu Yaya ika kundala! Unu, unu Mita dada ya dala? Unu, unu Kuzi mita dada ye Mita dada-a-mimi A pious ode that is only sung by hilichurls during sacrifices. &#91; Note 4 &#93; When performing this ode, the hilichurls often add percussion by beating the backsides of the weakest tribe members with planks, creating rhythmic ringing sounds. It must be quite painful. The seventh song: Mimi movo Mimi sada Mimi domu Domu upa Gusha dada It appears that many hilichurl tribes share a tradition of exchanging songs around bonfires in the moonlight. This song is one such bonfire ballad sung by the chief at the end of the night. At the end of the song, the chief shouts "nunu" three times, which presumably carries the meaning of "sleep."A diary left behind by the famed adventurer, Roald . The pages are littered with small amount of shiny but bitter salt crystals. — Sal Terrae — My shoes are completely waterlogged after trekking here from the banks of Dihua Marsh . The last time I took them off to pour the water out, a frog jumped out. From the scale of this ruin, I suspect it is the temple that provided safe refuge for civilians during the Archon War several millennia ago. I've heard that the God of Salt built such a place. Liyue folklore holds that she was the gentlest of the gods. In the brutality and chaos of wartime, human beings were puny and disposable. But the Salt God refused to join the other gods in their senseless battle for dominance, instead choosing to give shelter to those dispossessed by the war. She brought them here to build a new settlement. She showed them kindness and comfort. And even as global upheaval ushered in the end of an epoch, she worked tirelessly to bring about a return to peace between the gods. It seems that most parts of the ancient city have sunk into the riverbed of Bishui River . It's fortunate that the foundation of the temple is still here after all this time. She amassed a group of followers who settled in the area now known as Sal Terrae and lived a humble existence. The city stood for several centuries, finally falling with the downfall of the god herself. The gentlest of the gods fell not in battle at the hand of the other gods. She fell at the hand of one of her own people, the people she had loved so dearly. He was the first king of the people, and also the last. He had once loved the God of Salt just as the rest did, but as a mere mortal, he ultimately could not fathom the self-sacrificial love the god embodied. He sought after military might, in the hope that the city might be able to hold its own in defense and attack. And so, to demonstrate that gentleness was a virtue unfit for the times, he took a sword and ended the life of the lone, defenseless god. No sooner had she met her demise than the temple itself collapsed, and the people's city crumbled like salt into the earth. As for the treacherous king's fate, theories abound but none are certain. Some say he continued to reign in solitude from the ruins for centuries, finally turning to dust long after the cries of war had subsided, the ruins had been engulfed by the river, and insects had hollowed out his scepter. Other say that he took his own life after taking that of the god, unable to bear the guilt of deicide that weighed upon his conscience. In any case, the people on whom the Salt God had once looked so fondly became scattered across Liyue. In the safe haven of Liyue Harbor , under the rule of the Geo Archon , they and their stories survived, and that is why we still hear about them to this day. Rumors say that the Salt God's body can still be found somewhere in the depths of the ruins. Though her body has turned to salt, it still maintains her posture from the moment she was struck by the king's sword. It looks like we're in for some heavy rain: dark clouds are gathering as far as the eye can see. I'd better get moving. I'm going to head northwest to Mt. Qingce. Hopefully I can make it there before the rain gets too heavy. And hopefully it's not such a mad dash that I lose my diary en route... Vol. 2 A diary left behind by the famed adventurer, Roald , at a makeshift camp. It still looks new, and smells like the fragrant herbs of Mt. Qingce. — Qingce Village — Leaving Dragonspine , I waded through rivers, walked across shoals carpeted with silver grass, and made my way through sun-dappled bamboo forests, before finally arriving at Mt. Qingce. My shoes and clothes were all soaked from the heavy rain. Luckily, the elders in the village were kind enough to let me hang my clothes in the assembly hall. They even prepared dry clothes and some food for me. There were many children in Qingce Village. Sweet as they may be, they can become quite clingy. There were also many elders here. People living here seemed happy and carefree. The elders said that most of the young people had gone to work in Liyue Harbor. Many of them already had a family there and they would send money back every month. Having seen the prosperity and convenience of the city, it's hard for these young people to go back to the rural life here. Liyue Harbor has brought peace and prosperity to Qingce Village for the time being, but eventually it will also be the cause of its demise. Legend has it that the word "Qingce" originated from the name of an ancient monster " Chi ." "Chi," of course, is what we call it now in the contemporary language. But in ancient times, the people of Liyue pronounced it as "Qingce." An elder said that thousands of years ago, Morax defeated the sea serpent and brought peace back to Liyue. After Chi died, its body turned to stone, its blood became water, and its scales are now the terraced fields. The monster's nest became what we now call Mt. Qingce. But after a quick look, I believe the mountains consist of mostly rocks shattered by impacts from the outside. No traces of a hydro monster can be found in the rocks. Perhaps the corpse of Chi is long gone and this monster-turning-into-a-mountain thing is nothing but an ancient tale? My next destination is the lake located amongst the stone peaks of Jueyun Karst . It is said that there is a labyrinth where the Adepti live. Let's see if I can find them. Vol. 3 A diary of the famed adventurer, Roald , left by the lake. It tells of his plans after his adventures on Mt. Aocang . —Aocang Lake, Jueyun Karst — I seem to have lost yet another diary... I don't understand, I even made sure to say to myself three times: "Whatever you do, don't lose your diary." But then I got caught up in my adventure, and it went straight out of my head. I waste so much paper every year... I do hope the Dendro Archon won't mind. I have arrived at a mountain lake located high on Mt. Aocang. To get here, I had to hike up a winding dirt trail, make my way across perilous wooden walkways built by herb gatherers in ancient times, and then scale a steep, wet cliff. I was told by some fishermen that the lake is a thousand furlongs deep, but after taking a dip in the water I can safely say that their statements were pure hyperbole. The Qingce Village elders were right after all: the mountain lake's water is sweet and warm. This place certainly lives up to its reputation as a celestial paradise! Back when I had just arrived in Jueyun Karst, an old farmer told me that the adepti possess a mysterious magical ability that lets them turn into mist and roam in the sea of clouds. I dismissed it as an old wives' tale at the time, but seeing the way the mist over the lake rises up to the summit and merges with the sea of clouds, it does make me wonder... The adeptus I've been searching for could be roaming the clouds at the summit right now, for all I know, and I would be completely oblivious to it. I headed east down Mt. Aocang and ended up thoroughly lost in a thick forest. Finally, I came to a clearing and discovered I was back at the banks of the Bishui River . I have an excellent view of the surrounding area here, so I think this is where I'll camp for the night. While I was sorting through my things at the camp, I met a young lady who looked like she was out on a treasure hunt. She was called Eduardo, and she explained that she was heading west to look for a "Miraculous Lake" at the foot of Mt. Aocang: "Legends tell of an adeptus who lives beside a lake at the foot of Mt. Aocang on the northern side. If that's true, then that's sure to be where the adeptus keeps their secret treasure, too... Mwuhahaha, I know exactly what I'll do when I get my hands on that treasure!" Then she quickly changed her tune, as if suddenly realizing how she sounded: "I... I'd contact the Guild, and report to them if I found it! I am a proud member of the Adventurers' Guild , and I have absolutely no connection to the Treasure Hoarders!" Indeed, some adventurers are in the business for material wealth alone. I'm reminded of that classic Liyue saying, "To each their unfathomable own"... But whatever her motivations, she is a fellow adventurer nonetheless, and a genuine one at that. I must say, I was tempted to head west in search of this fabled "Miraculous Lake" myself after hearing Eduardo talk about it. But in the end I decided to stick with my existing plan. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, I will proceed to the Guili Plains to see what sights and treasures are waiting to be discovered there. And hopefully I won't lose my diary again this time — again, barring any unforeseen circumstances. I can't lose another one... May any unforeseen circumstances be well and truly barred. Vol. 4 A diary left behind by the famed adventurer, Roald , at a makeshift camp. It seems to have been dipped in water, with the watermark of a fox's footprint. — Luhua Pool — Traveling southeast along the Bishui River , I came across a pond at the foot of Mt. Tianheng on the north side. The water is clearer than the sky and the water temperature is similar to a human's body temperature. The water has a sweet aftertaste. A local herb gatherer told me that thousands of years ago, this pond was once a garden. It is said that during the era of the Archon War , two lovers, whose families disapproved of their relationship, made this place their rendezvous. However, the times were merciless, and the man left his lover to follow the Geo Archon . He plunged himself bravely into the conflict as a mortal among gods... and like so many mortals in those dark days, none heard from him again for centuries. The girl wandered the garden, awaiting the return of her lover. The flowers withered and grass grew in their place. Soaked in a flood, the grass rotted. And when the flood too had subsided, and to dust she had returned, her tears then converged into this pond. Perhaps it was her deep longing that made the water here so clear and gentle. I spent an afternoon here and nodded off while taking a bath in the pond. When I woke up, the stars were already glittering in the night sky. I noticed a baby fox slinking around me, but it got scared and ran away when I looked up. Not until later did I realize that one of my shoes was missing and my bag of provisions had been ransacked. It took longer than I expected to pack my luggage. My next destination is the delta of the Bishui River in the northeast — Yaoguang Shoal . Vol. 5 A diary left behind by the famed adventurer, Roald . The pages smell like the sea breeze. — Yaoguang Shoal — This is the delta of the Bishui River , where the sand and mud carried by the river has accumulated into an open and flat shoal. When I finally arrived, the shoal was shrouded in a blanket of fog, and my new shoes were soaked again. I heard the sound of some unknown monsters coming from the fog, but couldn't quite tell their exact location. All that was left to do was set up the tent and wait for this blasted fog to drift away. When I was staying at the Wangshu Inn , a merchant told me about the legends of Yaoguang Shoal. He started with a poem — "Jade-lustered waves washed into the ocean while a conch lay empty on the white shoal." The meaning of the poem is that the sunlight, pure as jade, glimmers on the surface of the Bishui River and seems to flow into the sea along with the river water. But the Greenconch Lodge on the Yaoguang Shoal has been unoccupied for some time. I once ventured into the fog to visit the Seashell Sanctuary, but didn't see the owner. A legend among fishermen has it that the Greenconch Lodge was the home of an adeptus — the green conch itself, in fact, constituting part of her very being. She provided shelter for travelers who were lost in the fog, took care of the shipwrecked survivors, and bid godspeed to other adepti on crusades against sea monsters. But older fishermen interpret the legend differently. They say that the Seashell Sanctuary was not the abode of an adeptus, but of a family that had lived in the giant seashell for generations. They devoted themselves to helping the lost&#160;and&#160;saved many fishermen's lives. It seems the fog is drifting away and the sun is almost visible now. Next up, I'll borrow a boat to get to Guyun Stone Forest and visit the ruins where the Geo Archon vanquished the sea monster . I should arrive in no time at all if the weather is good. Vol. 6 A diary left behind by the famed adventurer, Roald , by chance. The pages are damp and seem to have been soaked in water. — Guyun Stone Forest — We skirted past a few small islands occupied by Hilichurls , managing to steer clear of their line of sight, and made it to Guyun Stone Forest successfully. Six giant Stone Pillars kept the sun out of my eyes as I went ashore, and it was remarkably cool in their shade. The crabs on the beach were big and meaty. Maybe it's because the area has been nourished by the remains of a magical beast for millennia? Anyway, they taste great roasted. The sheer beauty of this place makes it hard to imagine that it was once the site of a bloody battle between the Geo Archon and the sea monster . Suffice to say the blood once shed here has long since vanished into the sea without a trace. I suppose that everything pales into insignificance when faced with the scale of the sea. Whether it's a single drop of an ordinary person's blood or rivers of blood shed collectively by the heroes of the past, the relentless flowing of the winds and waves are destined to wash every last trace of it away. In the end, everything will be just as it has always been, since time immemorial. Legend has it that the Geo Archon once carved a giant polearm out of the rocky land. He plunged it deep into the ocean, riding it straight through the body of the demon that wrought chaos upon his domain. Over the years, the wind gradually eroded the stone polearm into the form we see today. Later, I'll return to the mainland to camp out for the night. From where I am, I can see the ships leaving the harbor in the distance. As I write, the Crux is setting sail once more, embarking on its next grand voyage. I wonder what mission the Qixing Commerce Guild has entrusted to the legendary Captain Beidou this time? I had the most awful night's sleep last night. I dreamt I was somewhere pitch-black and damp. Suddenly, I was a sea monster, and my impaled body was being driven into the ocean floor by the Geo Archon's polearm. I writhed around and clutched at the giant polearm made of rock, trying desperately to free myself, but it was wedged firmly in place. Each movement I made filled me with agony, and with rage... Note to self: Guyun Stone Forest is not a good place to spend the night! I woke early, so I lit the campfire and I'll move out once the sky's bright. My next stop is Liyue Harbor : I just need to be somewhere that I can get my clothes washed, beard trimmed, that sort of thing. Once I've sorted myself out, I'm making another trip to Jueyun Karst . I didn't make any progress on finding the adepti last time. This time, I think I'll try my luck at Qingyun Peak . Another note to self: Do not lose my diary again! Vol. 7 A diary left behind by the famed adventurer, Roald . The pages have the scent of flowers that grow on cliffs. — Qingyun Peak , Jueyun Karst — I shall preface my adventurer's diary with a stern reminder to myself. Recently, I keep discovering that I've misplaced my diary every time I feel like I want to write in it. Oh, Roald, you must learn to be more careful in future! After climbing for what feels like an eternity, I have finally reached the top of the precipice. I'm surrounded by a sea of clouds. It's impossible to know where in the midst of that sea of clouds I once stood looking up at this celestial place where the adepti dwell. Apart from the few oddly-shaped trees, there are barely any signs of life here at the top of the precipice. Occasionally, a Lapis Glede will let out a high-pitched cry before diving down into the clouds and disappearing from view. Up the hill from here is the adeptus's dwelling, but there's a few things I need to sort out before I head up. The most pressing issue is repairing my climbing gear, I'll also tend to a few cuts and grazes while I'm at it. A kind farmer gave me some ointment when I first arrived in Jueyun Karst — it stings, but it really does work. Nights atop the precipice offer little in the way of comfort. The relentless wind above the clouds pierces to the bone. It's difficult to shelter oneself from it, because it finds its way to you through all the tiny gaps in the tent, and there's no way you could keep a campfire alight in this wind. A good night's sleep is therefore out of the question. I wonder if the adeptus who dwells at the summit ever gets lonely and dispirited being surrounded by nothing but the cold, heartless wind? At the end of a long and sleepless night, I finally watched the moon set into the sea of clouds. I'll make sure my pack is securely fastened, then at daybreak I'll begin my journey to the summit where the adeptus dwells. Hopefully, the altitude is high enough that it won't rain. Vol. 8 Diary of a renowned adventurer, Roald . Spots of shiny green moss can be seen among the pages. — Qingxu Pool — To stop me from losing my diary yet again, this time I've put a marker made of moss on the leather case. Now it really stands out in my backpack. It's perfect! Tonight, I'll put it beside my pillow before I go to sleep — there's no way I can lose it then. Honestly, I don't think I can keep calling myself an adventurer if I lose my diary one more time... a misadventurer, perhaps. I headed westward from the mountain pass at Mt. Tianheng and came to a ruin, known locally as Qingxu Pool. The entrance to the ruin is located right in the center of a giant rocky outcrop rising up from the center of a shallow pool. It is surrounded on all sides by steep cliff faces. There are several stone towers which blend in seamlessly with the natural scenery put here by the Geo Archon . The morning mist is beginning to clear and the first rays of sunlight are starting to illuminate the mountains and ruins. It looks like it'll be good weather today. Legends say that these ruins predate the Geo Archon's rule over Liyue. The whole of Lisha was covered by water at the time of the Archon War , and back then this rocky outcrop was nothing more than a little islet that rose above the water's surface. After peace was restored, the region of Lisha unfurled once more as the tides withdrew, revealing the ancient buildings erected by the early peoples. Back when I was at the Wangshu Inn I met a scholar from Sumeru called Soraya . She had done a fair bit of research on the ruins in Lisha. Once she got talking about it she could talk all day. What she told me was that these ruins were left behind by an evil god, whose name has been wiped from the record, and its people. But in the end, the sea gave way to forests and fields, the self-serving god was defeated, and the strongholds and temples of the ancient city the god's people once built were left to crumble. That is how Qingxu Pool came to be. The ruins were submerged until the long Archon War finally came to an end, emerging on the landscape as the tide subsided. Maybe these crumbling remains have been left as a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era for the adepti and the other deities. In any case, this is a calm and tranquil place that has, for whatever reason, remained entirely unperturbed by the relentless development of Liyue Harbor and untouched by the mining operation based at the Chasm . It has just been left, as-is, right to this day. Perversely, the only disturbances have come since the mining at the Chasm has been halted, as monsters have now occupied the ruins here. Let's just hope they don't destroy anything. It is a simple theory, but I need to gather more evidence. I should keep heading north and visit the ruins at Lingju Pass and Dunyu . I ran into Eduardo again just before I set off. She seemed to be traveling with a partner this time. She must have a busy adventurer's schedule — it seemed like I blinked and then she'd disappeared off into the ruins. Vol. 9 A journal left behind by a renowned adventurer Roald . Some of its pages are damaged and crumpled, and a few shimmering ice crystals are attached to them. — Dragonspine — I began my ascent of Dragonspine from its southern side, where the mountain meets the riverbanks and plains of Liyue. The mountain slopes gently here, the wind is soft, and the snow is light. Added to the unfrozen water sources, it makes this place a good choice for setting up a base camp. Once I have prepared my supplies, I will make a camp here before continuing my climb to the summit. After setting up camp, I took the chance to survey the surrounding ruins. What intrigued me is that the architectural style and artistic patterns are strikingly similar to those seen in ancient buildings elsewhere. This could very well mean that the fabled mountain civilization of old is right beneath my feet. Unfortunately, I did not find any well-preserved inscriptions within the ruins, so there was no hard proof of the ancient civilization's historicity. Perhaps, I will find more information is preserved further up the mountain, buried deep within the bitingly cold blizzards. Spending the night here is an unpleasant experience. The cold, damp wind chills to the bone, and the way it shakes the tent sounds like the roar of a rushing river. Guaranteed nightmare material for once you do manage to fall asleep. There's a cave by the water, and it must be spacious in there because I can hear the ghostly groaning of the wind echoing inside. Unfortunately, the entrance is tightly fenced off and there is simply no way to get through from the outside. I will start advancing further up the mountain a little later on. There are some remnants of the relatively recent past by the path, which if I'm not mistaken can be traced back to the era when Mondstadt was ruled by an aristocracy . I dug up some fragments of clothing and some irreparably damaged weaponry. The dense snow and ice seem to have slowed down the decomposition process, preserving any pieces of the past that they swallow up for a long time to come. The way that the items are distributed leads me to believe that a chase once took place here on this mountain path — or possibly even a murder . It seems that even fierce blizzards and sinister mutations pose no obstacle to humans intent on following through on their dark ambitions, In the end, this archon-forsaken snowscape has become stained by mortal transgression. As I climb further up the path, the wind becomes stronger and the temperature plummets to an unbearably low level. I scouted out a ruin to the northeast, where to my utter astonishment I found water! It was somehow unfrozen, in defiance of its perennially blizzard-beaten surroundings. From the location, I would estimate that it is linked to the stream I saw further downhill. However, this area is so cold that I could not afford to explore deeper inside the ruin for the risk of freezing to death or drowning. I left a makeshift sign there to mark the spot — I just hope that it doesn't get buried in the snow. I suppose that once upon a time this could have been an underground shelter and that over the years the groundwater has seeped in and flooded it. But I have also heard that the tyrants of the distant past were partial to a form of punishment whereby they would jail a prisoner, lock them in a cage, and then slowly pour water in. Just so they could force the prisoner to watch in alarm as the water slowly rose up from their ankles to their mouth, nose, and finally their forehead... Such a cruel and drawn out punishment... And in the sheer cold of this climate, it is all the more impossible to imagine that any managed to survive it. Further to the east, the road becomes more rugged. I had a stupid accident and very nearly broke my leg because of it. I was lucky to only receive a superficial wound and no major bone injury. But it also tore a great big hole in my windproof clothing, so now I feel the full force of the wind right against my skin. It feels awful, like being stabbed constantly with a sharp knife. I managed to find shelter from the wind before my wound went completely numb. I just about managed to sew my clothing back up, but there's no way I can continue to the summit like this. I made it back to camp, finally, on the verge of freezing to death. As I warmed my feet by the bonfire, I removed my socks to find that three of my toes had turned purple from the cold... But no matter, right now I'm still enjoying the feeling of coming back to life after such a close brush with death. When the storm died down a little, I looked up and caught a view of the peak, towering there silently against the dark sky, encircled by giant jagged rocks and yet secluded among them in the center. The bards' songs tell of an ancient, evil dragon who lies buried there in the mountain stream — I wonder if it, too, yearns for the celestial heights even as it gazes up with its rotting and blinded eyes? Many villagers who live at the foot of the mountain liken this monstrous mountain to a blind spot in the eyes of the gods, a place ruled by the inscrutable force of fate. Old Mondstadt fairy tales speak of the mountain as a place of punishment that was abandoned by the Wind of Time and left for the howling winds to sweep in and freeze everything in its moment of destruction. Yet something still stirs here, at the peak of the mountain. I heard its call in my dream. It was a gentle song, pleasing to the ear, but somehow disturbing to the mind. This trip was a disaster, but at least I came out of it alive. Farewell for today, Dragonspine. Perhaps I shall return, though I do not know if I will ever make it to your summit... I think I will explore Liyue next. But first things first, my top priority is replenishing my lost supplies. Oh, and while I'm at it, I think I'll swap this soggy old diary for a nice new one. Vol. 10 A diary left behind by the famed adventurer, Roald . The pages bear both the refreshing scent of sakura flowers and the bitterness of tobacco leaves. — Ritou — It's already been a few days since I've arrived in Ritou, and yet the Kanjou Commission still shows no sign of letting me pass. I don't know how long I'll have to stay... I hope Mr. Kurisu will find a way to get me out of here. Mr. Kurisu is the local commerce chairman. Originally from Fontaine , he is a reserved and friendly gentleman, possessing a certain charm that makes other outlanders feel at home. I'd heard that Inazuma didn't welcome travelers, but it wasn't until I set foot in Ritou that I realized the severity of the situation. The Sakoku Decree has been in effect for some time. While many travelers have chosen to stay on the island, many come and go, staying for only a brief period. Many merchants also packed up and went home. Ritou, in its current state, is a gloomy and depressing place. It is said that hundreds of years ago, Hiroshi of the Hiiragi Clan built this commercial port. He recruited talented merchants to set up shop here and encouraged free trade. Ritou flourished and prospered for some time... But poor Hiroshi would probably turn in his grave if he knew of the state that Ritou is in right now. Still, his descendant, the current Kanjou Commissioner , seems to be living the good life. It's enough to leave anyone feeling rather resentful. After a few days, Mr. Kurisu brought me some good news. He's heard that the Crux Fleet will stop by briefly in Inazuma. There should be a way for this famous armed fleet to smuggle me to another island, he said. I just need to be patient. I don't know if Mr. Kurisu's information is reliable, but it's always a good idea to be prepared. First, I must think of a way to get my camp-making and fire-starting tools back from Miss Yurika . I will beg if necessary... It seems that the Shogunate has attacked another Sangonomiya outpost, inflicting many casualties... or was that the other way around? The few outlanders who remain have all been gossiping. Even those in service of the Commissioner have been spreading various rumors without fear. It is unclear what has happened, but still more merchants have packed up and gone home. Many military ships have come and gone at the harbor, probably carrying emergency military provisions... Perhaps I can take advantage of the chaos and confusion to retrieve my stuff from the warehouse. Oh, and I must also remind myself...not to lose this diary again. There are diaries with covers that are more beautiful and elegant, of course... but that's no excuse for replacing the old with something new! Vol. 11 A diary left behind by the famed adventurer, Roald . The pages bear both the moist smell of the fog and a certain fungal scent. My exploration of Tsurumi Island has not gone smoothly. Earlier, it was thanks to a local youth named Kama that I was able to leave Ritou successfully and arrive on Tsurumi Island undetected. At his direction, I tried to penetrate the thick fog that shrouds the island and somehow managed to catch a hurried glimpse of the ancient civilization present here, as well as certain dream-like landscapes. However, these memories seem to have dispersed just like a mist might... But I can still clearly remember meeting a small child on this supposedly long-dead island. Perhaps he was nothing but a hallucination I saw under the influence of Elemental Particles floating through the fog, or perhaps the mushrooms on the island were to blame... That child may have just been an illusion or a false memory, and this would certainly follow common logic, of course. But the second time I came, I brought a little more food with me, in hopes that the child would accept them. It must be hard living on a dead island like this one, I thought. The next time I came ashore, I did not inform Kama, and thus got lost in the thick fog very quickly. I tried all means and ways, but could not find my way through the fog — it was as if it was rejecting me for reasons unknown.If it were not for the blonde-haired traveler and the little fairy named " Paimon ," I would probably have had to return empty-handed. But they helped me to pick some local Fluorescent Fungus , which is rumored among Inazumans to have coalesced from the memories of the ancient dead of Tsurumi Island, which give them their phosphorescent, ghostly glow. They possess the ability to strengthen the eyes and mind and improve one's memory. I tried some over the last few days, and these fungi do indeed have the ability to calm the heart and cheer the spirit. It appears to be good for digestion as well... That said, I haven't seen any marked improvement in my memory yet. I must remember to leave a few for my friend in Sumeru to conduct research on. Additionally, I found the pictures of the ancient murals that the blonde traveler and Paimon brought to be most fascinating — they are certainly worth further research. That we were able to discover such valuable historical ruins at all is owed to the passion, wisdom, and determination of these two exceptional adventurers.

letter treasured by Dongdong from Qingce Village . It seems to be a letter from his father. Dear Dongdong, Time flies, doesn't it? It's been nearly three months since I left. Do you miss me? I do hope you're going to bed on time and not causing any trouble for grandma and grandpa. I'll be back from Inazuma very soon, and I promise when I get back I'll take you to see The Crux down at the harbor. I won't let you down this time! Dongdong, do you remember the beach at Yaoguang Shoal ? Well I went there, and I collected lots and lots of beautiful, golden sand. More than I can carry by myself. When I'm back, we should buy up the local mill and make fresh tofu every single day. Although, I'd rather use all this gold to buy a house in Liyue Harbor . A huge house with a splendid sea view. I'll let you decide how to spend it when I'm back. How does that sound? Guess what? Just opposite Luhua Pool at the Guili Plains there's an enormous cliff, and what did I find there? A Ruin Guard ! He was just sitting there, slumped over, completely still. He didn't flinch even in the thunder and lightning, not even when the rain was pelting down on him. Then I realized, he must be sleeping! So I climbed up on top of him, threw my arms around that big old head of his, and twisted it as hard as I could. There was a clunking noise, followed by a loud boom, and suddenly his head fell off and rolled straight off the cliff! It smashed into a million pieces at the bottom. Shame really, otherwise I would have brought it home as a trophy, and you could have had a proper up-close look at what a Ruin Guard's head looks like. Imagine that! I also went to Jueyun Karst . I must take you there when you're older. The scenery there is incredible. The billowing clouds look like an ocean, the waterfall is infinitely better than the one in Qingce Village, and you can sometimes catch a glimpse of the realm of the adepti in the mountains. You can't begin to imagine how beautiful it was. And guess what? You're not gonna believe this but... I met an actual, real-life adeptus! We sat and drank together, chatting and laughing away... The adeptus gave me a gift too: a magic wine bottle. All you need to do is blow on it, and an infinite supply of wine will flow from the inside! You absolutely mustn't touch it though, do you understand? You're way too young to drink. When you're older, though, all my treasures will be yours to do with as you please. My adventures in Liyue are coming to an end. It's time for me to head to the harbor, where I'll hop on the Crux and sail off to somewhere even further away. I'm excited to see what wonderful sights and valuable treasures are waiting for me at the next stop, and I can't wait to share them all with you! Until then Dongdong, please make sure you go to bed on time every night. And don't eat too many sweets, they'll rot your teeth. Please also be nice to your grandma and grandpa — seriously, don't do anything to make them mad. And no fighting! I will be home soon. Lots of love, Daddy x Vol. 2 A diary left behind by someone in the wilderness that tells of the owner's unfortunate encounters at Yaoguang Shoal . — Yaoguang Shoal — The fog is setting in again... The idea of panning for gold here has turned out to be a complete waste of time. I should have known not to trust this old mining crew, it must have been several decades since the last of them retired! Every last bit of information they gave me is completely out of date... utterly useless. This is turning into a complete farce. I would say I'll be going home empty-handed tonight, but the chances of me finding my way home at all in this fog are looking slim... I hope Dongdong's eaten dinner. I can hear hilichurls somewhere in the distance. I have no idea where I'm going in this fog, so I suppose I'll just focus on walking away from the hilichurls' voices. Hopefully I'll make it out alive... I don't know how long I've been walking, and in this fog I don't even know if it's daytime or nighttime. Hang on, are those silhouettes I see up ahead? By the good grace of the Geo Lord, maybe I can join along with them and find a way out of here. Yep, that's what I'm gonna do. Hooray, I'm saved! On closer inspection, the silhouettes didn't look like friendly characters. I've decided to set up a camp here and wait for them to leave before figuring out my next move. I might have to go back the way I came. Egads! I can hear hilichurls all around me... I should definitely— -End of diary content- Vol. 3 A diary left behind by someone in the wilderness that tells of the owner's unfortunate encounters at Guili Plains . — Guili Plains — What a string of bad luck... I finally made it out of that hilichurl camp alive, only to end up nearly being killed by a Ruin Guard! I'd figured it was probably out of action given the way it was sat there completely motionless in the torrential rain. But then a bolt of lightning struck it right on the head... There was some whirring and grinding, and suddenly it was back to life. I was powerless to defend myself against it. It lifted me up like a baby bird and tossed me from the top of the cliff. Luckily, amidst my frantic scrambling, I managed to duck into a cave at the foot of the cliff. It was out of his line of sight, so it gave up trying to find me. If not for that cave, it'd have ripped me to shreds, thrown me to the ground, and then stomped me into... I don't even know what you'd call it by that point! Surely it must be well away from here by now... Even so, I can still hear the droning noise it made, like a swarm of bees buzzing around inside my head. I think I must have broken my arm, because it hurts when I put any pressure on it. I think xe2x80x93 I hope xe2x80x93 that I will be able to manage, though. In any case, at my age I need to grin and bear it. I mean, what would Dongdong and his mother think of me if I didn't? Vol. 4 A diary left behind by someone in the wilderness that tells of the owner's adventures at Jueyun Karst . — Jueyun Karst — Near the foot of the cliff, I ran into a herb gatherer who helped me set the bone. I almost passed out from the pain. But he did say that most passers-by he meets who have survived an encounter with a Ruin Guard tend to be less physically intact than I am... Every cloud has a silver lining, I guess. From above, Jueyun Karst looks completely untouched by human activity. It's also shrouded in mist, and to add to the mystery it's impossible to know just how deep the mist goes. Strange noises can be heard coming from the stone forest. Whether it's illuminated beasts or celestial beings in there, I don't know. All I know is it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. With any luck I should be able to pick up a quality chunk of amber here, or maybe some highly prized medicinal herbs. I know that back in the day many of poorer village folks made their fortunes and built their lives in Liyue by selling herbal medicine, and I see no reason why I couldn't do the same. It rained heavily in the evening, which meant the cliff face was too slippery to climb up. I also couldn't find my climbing rope or axe anywhere. It's strange, I'm not the type to lose things so easily... I'll bet one of the monsters lurking in the mountains pinched it when I wasn't looking! Maybe it was a fox... After several days of fruitless searching, I finally found some good medicinal herbs so I'm getting ready to head back. I had wanted to do one final search, but this place is starting to creep me out. As soon as night falls I keep thinking I see shadowy figures following me everywhere... Also, the blood-curdling cries of some unknown species of monster are now coming from all directions — and they're getting closer... During my descent down the mountain, I came across an old wine bottle. I gave it a rinse with some spring water, and found it's in good condition. I bet Dongdong would like it if I gave it to him as a souvenir. I'll just tell him that it was a treasure given to me by an adeptus. Vol. 5 A diary left behind by someone in Liyue that tells of the owner's adventures there. — Liyue Harbor — I sold the herbs at Bubu Pharmacy . Made back everything I've lost, plus a little extra. At this rate, I could buy a house in Liyue within the next few years. Just in time for Dongdong to settle in before he starts school. If I'd studied harder when I was younger, I wouldn't have ended up getting involved with those scumbag Treasure Thieves . I also wouldn't have squandered the inheritance my father left me. This makes me think that I must get Dongdong a good teacher who makes him study hard. That's the only way he'll make reliable friends and not end up like his wretched old man. So, for Dongdong's sake, I can't give up now. I have got to find a way to make a good living. ...That said, I couldn't get the idea of making a quick fortune out of my head. So I tried my luck at The Jade Mystery . I hadn't intended to spend any money at a place like that, but the boss, Shitou , was very persuasive... He talked me into putting all my money into it. I didn't do too badly. I cut open the stone I bought and found it to be higher-quality jade. Then again, that one brief foray into the world of gambling on stones meant that I had to pawn the sickle and the medicine box I'd used for foraging for herbs. I'm penniless now. Sure, I got some good jade pieces from gambling on stones, but jade isn't easy to shift. So it looks like I'm back in survival mode again. I think I'll head overseas and see how it goes. I should try joining the Crux Fleet , here's hoping Captain Beidou will take me on. I'll happily scrub the deck if it comes to it, I haven't eaten in three days. Vol. 6 A diary left behind by someone in the wilderness that tells of the owner's unfortunate encounters at Jinren Island . — Jinren Island — After stealing a small boat from the pirate ship, I rowed for three days before finally reaching shore. From here, I can see the legendary Takayama on Narukami Island , along with the giant sakura tree that grows on it. The colors of the Sacred Sakura are gentle in the moonlight... It makes me think of home. I wonder if Dongdong feels lonely in Qingce Village. I don't know if I made the right decision, coming all this way just to make a living. It's probably me just getting old, thinking about all this nonsense. I stumbled upon a purple melon while exploring this remote island. It tasted astringent, and rather lacked taste; my teeth and tongue turned purple from eating the skin and it took a while for the color to fade... Next time I'll try cooking it before eating. I've set up camp. At first light, I'll walk south... I heard the pirates say that that's where Inazuma is. There should be plenty of job opportunities in the city. Maybe I should give up the foolish idea of adventuring and find a real job. When I've saved up enough money and bought my own house, I'll send for Dongdong to come live with me. Besides, the housing here is much cheaper than in Liyue Harbor.

It's quite a page turner. This segment is on the legends of stone beasts. —Stone Beasts— Stone statues appear all across the vast land of Liyue. Most were built by locals who prayed to them for favorable weather and peace steadfast as the mountains. But it is claimed that some have a much more ancient history. One story regarding the animal statues in particular is popular among the fishermen of the Bishui River , the Silvergrass harvesters of Dihua Marsh , and the old mining crowd. They say that in some corners of the land, ancient stone beasts wake at night in the cool of the fall and look around at a world that has slowly become alien to them. Hearing the sounds of frogs and insects greeting them, they respond with deep, soulful cries from their petrified throats. Then they roam around Liyue, inspecting once more the land they used to protect. To my knowledge, no one has ever witnessed a stone beast in motion firsthand. However, local residents who know the territory extremely well have long observed and accepted the phenomenon that the animal statues can change location and posture overnight. Meanwhile, light-sleeping campers often report hearing a sound in the middle of the night that is like flowing water, only much deeper in tone. As for where these stone beasts originally came from, the elders of Qingce Village say they are illuminated beasts who once fought alongside Rex Lapis in the Archon War . After the war ended, the tide subsided and peace was restored. The illuminated beasts were no longer required to serve as defenders of the common people, and one by one they retreated to more secluded parts of the country. There they lived free from concern for mortal affairs. But some illuminated beasts remembered with fondness the glorious days when they served under Rex Lapis, and they pined for the years when they protected Liyue. Though they were not of the mortal realm, nor were they immortal: For them, too, life would one day come to an end. Thus, they beseeched Rex Lapis to turn their ephemeral flesh bodies into everlasting stone. The merciful Geo Archon granted their request and made them as such. Vol. 2 A collection of folk stories, myths, and legends from Liyue. It's quite a page-turner. This segment is on ancient fictional stories. —Palace Beneath the Sea— The day had arrived. It was time to collect the bride. The Sea God looked majestic indeed as he sat center stage in his giant clam, holding in his hands the reins of two sea serpents. They stood as imposing as Mt. Tianheng before the royal carriage as their master accepted the gifts of pearls from the village elders and welcomed his new bride aboard the carriage. In return, the village would receive the Sea God's blessing: a year free from tempests and tsunamis. The bride was whisked away to a place deep beneath the waves, far from home, far from the reveling crowds celebrating the festival, and far from her mother all alone. The Sea God took her along a corridor of great columns, formed from the skeleton of a dead whale, that led to a palatial gate adorned with shining pearls and iridescent shells. Finally, the young bride had arrived at the palace the Sea God had made for her. The palace that was to be her new home. "It was not my plan to meddle in the affairs of common people," came the god's voice rippling through the water. It was a husband's attempt to console his bride. "This place has served as a new home for many other young women, and it also became the place they spent their final days. Many of them were driven away from the village where they were born. For them, the ocean had provided safe refuge. Somewhere they could sleep peacefully without fear of being disturbed. Somewhere they could call home." But this young woman did not want a new home decorated with prize pearls and rare shells. The dazzling spectacle of the ocean floor — and the creatures that she knew lurked in the darkness — filled her not with peace, but with dread. Time went by, and the longer she stayed in her bewildering ocean chamber that knew not sunrise nor sunset, the more homesick she grew — and the frailer she became. Eventually, there came a day when the Sea God sensed what his young bride was feeling. Though saddened by her choice, he allowed her to go through with her decision. "In the fallen world of the humans, there will come a day in your life when you regret this decision." The Sea God took the shell of a sea snail that adorned his waist and handed it to her as a parting gift. "There will come a day that you blow into this shell, and it will sound like a horn. On that day, you shall return to this place." The young woman took the shell and returned to the land. The years went by, and soon she became a mother herself. As she went about her simple, peaceful life, the ocean palace seemed but a childhood dream. The dazzling sights and grotesque creatures would once in a while flood into her mind from the murky depths of her memory, but it was a rare occurrence, and she put them out of her mind. She lived like this year after year. Until one year, when the festival came once again, the village elders came to her home. They had come to take her daughter from her arms. It was then that she finally understood why the Sea God had spoken of her regret, and of her return, all those years ago. On the eve of the festival, she blew into the shell, and it sounded like a horn. The Sea God responded to the call, rising up from the billowing waves to greet the village. But his embrace was a tidal wave that engulfed the village, and took the villagers and elders in their sleep. Drawn by giant sea serpents, a colossal clam carriage came to a halt in front of her, dazzling her with its shimmering pearls. The mother took her daughter by the hand and boarded the Sea God's clam. It was just like she remembered from her childhood — only this time, the village she left behind now lay in ruins beneath the ocean waves. Vol. 3 A collection of folk stories, myths, and legends from Liyue. It's quite a page-turner. This segment is on the origin of Wuwang Hill . —Wuwang— Hiding between the jagged peaks in the north of Mt. Qingce is a slope known as Wuwang Hill, a palpably ominous place and the setting of many tales of supernatural phenomena. It is rumored by Liyue that the spirits of the dead lurk within the woods on Wuwang Hill. They roam the perimeter of the decrepit village, wandering among the withering trees and rotting foliage, eternally yearning for things left unresolved in living years. These floating spirits often entice unsuspecting passers-by away from the main path and onto treacherous mountain tracks that leads them tumbling into a river or straight into an ambush of ravenous monsters. It is this phenomenon from which Wuwang Hill derives its name. Wuwang means "prudence" in the common tongue, and Wuwang Hill is said to be "the hill where the prudent are punished." For even those travelers who do not act rashly or impulsively on their journey are doomed to be ensnared by the malevolence that lingers here like the mist in the mountain air. Both innocent villagers and ignorant visitors alike are susceptible to the deception of the Wuwang Hill spirits, which draw them deep into dark woods where thick mist blots out the sky and unknown dangers lurk in the shadows. There are many means by which these sinister spirits are able to deceive mortals. Some take the form of bereavement or grief, others of regret, manifesting as voices and visages of the deceased, the love of the departed, or the remorse of another party in an unresolved dispute. The traveler finds themselves compelled to heed the spirit's cry, and follows them into the depths of Wuwang. But Wuwang Hill was not always this way. Some signs of life remained there up until relatively recently, and in times gone by the village at the foot of the slope enjoyed a peaceful and leisurely existence, the chimneys always smoking and the lanterns always lit. That same village stands abandoned today... The buildings are in ruins and all that remains of the villagers is the indistinct murmuring from a realm beyond. There is a fable that is oft-repeated among the children of Qingce Village. It holds that the young people of Wuwang Hill, enchanted by the whale-like song of a faraway sea monster, all threw themselves into the gently flowing Bishui River in pursuit of false promises and childlike dreams. Along the river they floated, making their way to the Sea of Clouds, where they became one with the waves and lost all memory of the woods and their village on the hill... Their dreams, meanwhile, became the sea monster's song. Generation after generation of young people disappeared in this way, until in the end, the sole remaining residents of Wuwang Hill were old and gray. One by one, they left this mortal plane amidst sighs of grief. The bright lights of Liyue Harbor , Rex Lapis's pride and joy, burned ever brighter, while another neglected mountain village turned into a silent ghost town. But unlike the fleeting and fickle human mind, the ever-flowing ley lines remember all. Surging elemental energy takes on spirit form to recreate all the dreams, both fair and foul, of Wuwang Hill's erstwhile residents. Much like a mother who once lost a child and now searches desperately through their irretrievable past for a way to bring everything back, the ley lines — albeit unconsciously — repeatedly recreate the past and those who inhabited it. The way each looked, the way each child cried, the way the elderly would sigh in their twilight years. Each moment of joy, and each moment of sorrow. And like the hypnotic song of the great creature of the deep sea, it unintentionally lures toward it any nostalgic soul who would dare trespass here. Vol. 4 A collection of folk stories, myths, and legends from Liyue. It's quite a page-turner. This segment features the stories of Seelie living in the mountains. —Mountain Spirits— Many lone seelie are found floating in the mountain forests of Liyue. These glowing spirits are unfailingly found hovering in the mountain mist, in the ruins of ancient cities, or in crumbling, decrepit villages. Should a Vision -bearer draw near, the seelie will guide the way for them, leading them to long-hidden treasure or unfathomably ingenious mechanisms. The people of Liyue believe these tiny, silent spirits to be auspicious sightings, the souls either of departed adepti or unnamed benevolent gods of old. Others believe they are the echoes of strangers without kin, lingering in the mountains to guide lonely, lost visitors onto the path back home. Another old legend told in the mountain villages claims that there was once a time, before the adepti had come into being, when the seelie who meander in the mountains knew an altogether different existence, one in which they had beautiful physical forms and possessed great wisdom. That era, when the seelie roamed the mountains and strolled through the grand halls in the cities of old, is said to date back even further that the days when Rex Lapis fought bitterly against countless rival gods. At a far-flung moment in the distant past, the ancestor of the seelie met a traveler from afar, with whom they swore an oath of union witnessed by the three sisters of the Lunar Palace . Just thirty days later, a sudden disaster struck. The seelie and their lover fled into exile as the world collapsed around them, fleeing until the terrible calamity caught up with and seized them. Their cruel punishment was to be separated from each other for eternity and to have their memories wiped without a trace. The graceful but heartbroken seelie and the sisters grew more sullen and withdrawn with each passing day, to the point where their wondrous forms withered away, leaving fragments of their former selves scattered in the mountains and ruins, where they turned into tiny little life forms. They had forgotten so much, lost so much, and been stripped of their voices and wisdom, yet they continued to sing the same songs of grief. Because of this, still harboring a shred of the deep love they once had for their long-lost lover, they will act as guides to travelers who stop in the mountain mist, seeking to retrace their memories of an ancient story in long-abandoned ruins, disused makeup cabinets, and now-undecipherable poetry. Of course, these are nothing but clumsy, incoherent folk tales, wild and fantastical conjecture about what Liyue may have been like in the distant past before the time of Rex Lapis. Needless to say, such tales have no credibility whatsoever. The true origin of these sorrowful spirits that meander in the mountains is, however, still widely debated, and no consensus has ever been reached on the topic. Vol. 5 A collection of folk stories, myths, and legends from Liyue. It's quite a page-turner. This segment is on the shared history of qilins and humans. —Qilin— Among the legends that circulate in the mountains of Liyue, the qilin are a type of noble and benevolent illuminated beast. Qilin often roam the mountain forests, but appear only on nights where starlight shines upon clear dew. For sustenance, they drink only spring water and eat only fragrant herbs. Qilin are gentle illuminated beasts, with grace and elegance flowing through their veins. It is said that qilin will never harm living things, refusing even to step on an insect or break a blade of grass. People believe that a qilin's characteristics, behavior, and their every movement is dictated by an age-old etiquette that has remained unchanged for a thousand years. Following the barbarous age of the Archon War, many adepti became unable to continue living among the clamorous world of mortals. As a result, and under the direction of Rex Lapis, they withdrew themselves from society to live in seclusion in the bamboo groves and mountains. No longer would they interfere in the human world, content instead to enjoy a realm of mountains and water and pursue their own interests. Yet some illuminated beasts there were that, over a thousand years of mortal cooperation, had cultivated deep friendships with ordinary humans. They decided to carry out the will of the Lord of Geo in the mortal realm, assisting human society with their adeptal powers and charity. Some hid in mountain hamlets, others walked the bustling city streets. They lived together and mixed with humankind, leaving behind unique bloodlines in Liyue Harbor. According to one folktale, as early as several thousand years ago, there were already those among the elegant qilin who had begun to grow deeply attached to the savage mortals. The tale tells of how in that barbaric era, the people wore clothes of water lotus and bay leaf. One night, a herb gatherer was bathing in a mountain pool, when to his surprise, a passing qilin began to eat the clothes that he had left by the water's edge. The illuminated beast was too young to understand human notions of shame and privacy and had yet to learn the conduct of illuminated beasts in the mortal realm. To make up for her crude behavior and to avoid startling the vulnerable mortal with her otherworldly adeptal appearance, she transformed into one of human bearing. As the pale light of the full moon fell onto the pool, she appeared before the herb gatherer. The young illuminated beast ultimately did not understand human notions of shame and privacy. She stood in that mountain forest, lit by cold moonlight and the glow of fireflies, clothed only in dewdrops and the lunar gleam. Together with the ignorant mortal she traveled, strolling happily among flowers and bamboo groves, revealing to him the mountain dwelling of the adepti, interpreting for him the language of the birds, sleeping lightly amid the cry of insects, sinking softly into shared and ancient dreams... As the herb gatherer began to stir at the first light of dawn, he awoke to find that the noble illuminated beast had vanished without a trace. As for how this tale unfolds, opinions vary widely. Some people say that one night, the qilin placed a bamboo basket outside the front door of the herb gatherer's home, before disappearing into the moonlit mist. When the herb gatherer came to the door, he found a child soundly asleep inside the basket. Others say that from that moment on the qilin lived together with the mortal, gave birth to children, and grew accustomed to human life. No matter the truth of the thousand-year-old matter, the elegant illuminated beasts continue to walk among the residents of Liyue, unseen among the sea of people, waiting for the day when Rex Lapis calls them forth once again. Vol. 6 A collection of folk stories, myths, and legends from Liyue. It's quite a page-turner. This segment is on the Dunyu Ruins . —Hidden Jade— In the valley northwest of Liyue Harbor and south of Nantianmen lie many silent, ancient ruins. One of these areas is known as the Dunyu Ruins. This area is said to have already existed even before the time of the Archon Wars. According to old legends passed by word of mouth, "Dunyu" means "the land to which beauteous jade flees." &#91; TNxe2x80xa2 1 &#93; In a past beyond memory, when even Rex Lapis would still have been young, a star fell from the sky into the barren plains west of Liyue. These plains were transformed into a huge and deep chasm in the wake of that star's descent, and jade would emerge from within, beautiful and limitless, and it would become the foundation for a thousand years of industrial mining in Liyue thereafter. Legend has it that when that nameless star fell, a fragment of it broke off and crashed into the rocks in northern Lisha . As most know, wordless stones harbored soul and spirit, and in manners and times not witnessed by mortal eyes they watched and listened to the ley lines' pulses, the echoes of the alpine springs, and the slow but inexorable movements of the mountains. But unlike the ordinary but enduring stone of the earth, the fragments of the meteorite that fell from heaven had a proud and agitated temper. Later, when countless gods and rulers fought over the appointed celestial seats, and the very stars and abyss themselves faded, tragedy and evil embarred the breath of the waters and mountains. The fallen star could bear this no longer, and heedless of the great chasm's persuasions to stay it leaped away, away towards the heavens. As it returned to the skies, the heavenly jade left behind a deep pit, within which humans would build great cities and mighty fortresses, finding refuge and shutting themselves in with the leftover inheritance of that fallen star. Over the tumult and storms of the next few thousand years, the redoubts of the Dunyu Valley stood tall and maintained prosperous relations with Liyue Harbor up till 500 years ago. But with the coming of the black calamity and the rise of the Abyss , the residents of Dunyu sealed the ancient city and departed for other lands. None know why these refugees chose to shut the gates of their home, and even the millennia-old adepti and yaksha are silent on this matter. And so, the sealed fortresses became giant, silent tombs, with naught left in them but the sound of pond water and the wind whistling through empty halls — and thusly, too, did they come to be called the "Dunyu Ruins" by the people of Liyue. Locations Vol. 1 Vol. 1 Location Vol. 1 Additional context Vol. 3 Vol. 3 Location Vol. 3 Additional contextIt contains the investigations and observations into the cultural customs of the hilichurls by the "Poet Laureate of Hilichurlian ," Jacob Musk , a Mondstadt ecologist. This volume features the social structure and characteristics of the hilichurls. Hilichurlian Social Structure The social structure of the hilichurl race is evidently a primitive, tribal one. Small-sized hilichurl tribes are prolific in occurrence throughout the wilderness. It seems that they conceive of the tribe as akin to a large, extended family. By far the most powerful figure in the hilichurl tribe is the Shaman . Extensive field research confirms that the Shaman is the oldest member of the tribe and plays a role in it analogous to that of the parent in the family: managing major affairs and making policy decisions, based on their wealth of experience. Additionally, Shamans act as protector to their tribe using their elemental abilities. Shamans can be identified by their distinctive appearance from other tribe members: They wear horned, smiling-face masks with eye holes at the mouth, and wield a rudimentary Shaman's staff in their hands. A further identifying feature is that they will be heard chanting to themselves some form of unintelligible hymn or incantation. Age is not always the deciding factor when it comes to status in the tribe. In some tribes, Shamans are ousted from leadership by physically larger Hilichurls with superior combat skills. Under leadership of this kind, such tribes tend to become more aggressive. The chiefs of these tribes can easily be identified from their large stature and ostentatious masks, which also bear horns. The hilichurls' hostility towards outsiders, coupled with the obvious language barriers, means that conducting specific research on the distribution of resources within tribes has been all but impossible. Nevertheless, Knights of Favonius ' patrol reports suggest that resources are typically shared on the basis of "to each according to his needs". All tribe members are both gatherers and soldiers, but some that prize combat above others develop into seasoned heavyweights of the battlefield. If the tribe stays long enough in an unfavorable environment, these heavyweights will become its most respected leaders. Interestingly, hilichurls seem to have a unique ability to manipulate the elements despite their low intelligence and primitive social structure. The ability is most notably manifested in the Shamans. Typically, humans require a Vision in order to exercise elemental control. The question of how Hilichurls are able to do so without a Vision is, therefore, one that requires further investigation and analysis. Vol. 2 It contains the investigations and observations into the cultural customs of the hilichurls by the "Poet Laureate of Hilichurlian," Jacob Musk, a Mondstadt ecologist. This volume explores the diverse cultural customs of the hilichurls in relation to Mondstadt's. Hilichurl Spirituality Just as the inhabitants of the Seven Nations of Teyvat each have their religious beliefs, so too do the hilichurls. However, they worship not a specific figurehead with a presence in this world — such as one of The Seven — but elemental power itself in a more abstract sense. For instance, some hilichurl tribes in Mondstadt revere Anemo just as their human counterparts do, but they do not recognize the Anemo Archon Barbatos . Instead, they worship the power of Anemo itself. Hilichurls holding different elemental beliefs often live together in the same tribe. An individual hilichurl's elemental affiliation can be deduced from the designs on their masks and the color of their body paint. Firsthand observations indicate that the Shaman, responsible for organizing offerings and worship ceremonies for the tribe, applies a colored dye to their hair and skin, with the color representing the element they worship. Shamans are dressed and adorned more ornately than ordinary tribe members, but owing to the limited intelligence of the hilichurls it is highly doubtful that any of the fine ornaments worn are crafted by their own hand. The Shaman is the spiritual leader of his tribe. He leads them in song and dance during worship, singing hymns of praise to the elements. If there is leftover meat from the hunt, the hilichurls place it on the altar, raw, as sacrifice. Even though they accumulate ample Mora, precious stones, and other items of value through exploring, looting, mugging, and other means, it would appear that raw meat alone is considered a sufficient sacrifice. It would appear that the hilichurls possess no concept of either the past or future, living only in the present. They do not intentionally store up food for survival, nor do they commemorate their deceased forebears. Though crude attempts at something like calligraphy have been widely observed within their camps, closer inspection reveals these markings to be nothing more than botched imitations of what they have seen in ancient ruins, possessing no originality whatsoever. Hilichurls do seem to have an inexplicable affinity for remnants of the past, evidenced by the fact that ruins are one of their preferred locations to camp. But investigations thus far have turned up nothing which might hint at the true nature of their connection with the lost civilizations to which these ruins belong. Vol. 3 It contains the investigations and observations into the cultural customs of the hilichurls by the "Poet Laureate of Hilichurlian," Jacob Musk, a Mondstadt ecologist. This volume features mysterious hilichurls who live apart from others. The Mysterious Loners Among the Hilichurls exists a kind of mysterious, large creature possessing both immense physical strength and the ability to control the elements. They use this elemental ability to further enhance their physical state, such as to protect themselves or increase the brute force of their attacks — a combination making them nearly unstoppable. These powerful Hilichurls are called "Lawa" by the rest of the tribe, a respectful form of address best translated to mean "king" or "chief". However, Lawa don't actually rule over or lead the tribe at all. Rather, these large loners prefer solitude, avoiding the looks of reverence from the smaller Hilichurls. Adventurers very rarely encounter these gigantic creatures. Still, even the most seasoned adventurers will think twice before going on expeditions into areas where these dangerous Lawas may be roaming. Vol. 4 It contains the investigations and observations into the cultural customs of the hilichurls by the "Poet Laureate of Hilichurlian," Jacob Musk, a Mondstadt ecologist. This volume explores the diverse cultural customs of the hilichurls in relation to Mondstadt's. Dadaupa Gorge , Mondstadt: a Case for Cultural Diversity Among the Hilichurls The Meaty tribe is fond of feasting. They have built a boar-rearing pen in the center of their settlement and assigned a swineherd to watch over it. Over a natural stove made with a Pyro Slime, they cook boar stew in a single, large pot from which each tribe member feeds according to their needs. The most striking feature of this tribe is its sizable combat arena. Those who set foot in the arena are understood to be accepting an open invitation to engage in combat, and those subsequently ousted from it face being mocked by the entire tribe. The Sleeper tribe is prone to sleeping at every opportunity. They have built themselves an environment especially conducive to sleep, consisting of simple, wooden huts furnished with soft animal hide for beds. They are the most cunning and devious of the hilichurl tribes, and their above-average mental capacity can perhaps be attributed to the superior sleep quality they enjoy. The practices of the Eclipse tribe are the most occult of any in Mondstadt. They concern themselves neither with brains nor brawn, but with occult power. Distinct from the elemental powers worshipped by their peers, the object of their worship is a crude symbol that appears to represent an eclipsed sun. Their shamans are more powerful than those of the other tribes. In the center of their settlement, the other tribe members have built a grand throne for the most formidable of shamans who leads them.Ballads that have been passed down since the aristocratic period and are said to come from Ragnvindr the Dawn Knight himself. They tell of Ragnvindr's days as a knight's squire. Down every street in Mondstadt have I strolled. The air was filled with the stench of misery and the buzz of revelry. I saw the most arrogant of aristocrats, And I saw the most pitiful of the impoverished. At night these streets are a spider's web—some here to feast, others their eternal prey. I hear a jangling in the night, and know it is the chains that fetter the souls of the oppressed. I patrol the streets of Mondstadt at nighttime, Where my peers and superiors would once declare: "We are the starlit knights, lift thy heads and bear witness!" "For we, who raise our flag in the splendor of starlight, are the true protectors of Mondstadt!" But not once have I lifted my head to the stars, or gazed at our flag: For I cannot shift my focus from the filthy street corners. Destitute peddlers weep in silence. Aging soldiers grimace in pain. In the deathly stillness of night, A young girl, rejected by the Aristocracy, pleads for Barbatos ' mercy. The sighing of mournful winds rattles the Cathedral gate, Carrying within them the grief of the oppressed, they assault splendid palatial walls. Each mother's call, Each infant's cry, Enough to dent the hardest of shields. Enough to shatter the sharpest of swords. Sounds of sorrow send shivers down my spine. But in the palace, and in the castle, Though the wind blows the same over holy ground, They are but the sighs of ants to the ears of men. Vol. 2 Ballads that have been passed down since the aristocratic period and are said to have come from Ragnvindr the Dawn Knight himself. They tell of Ragnvindr's friendship with a sword-dancer . One day, at the crack of dawn, A dancer whose sword was her song set foot in Mondstadt. Though clad in chains with cuffed hands and fettered feet, In her silence lay a song: It was the song of freedom. A song of a brighter dawn beyond the walls, A joyous ballad sung without reservation by a people unrestrained. She was the dawnlight of the Wanderer's Troupe , But she spelled eternal midnight for the Aristocracy. I once asked her, "Why do you come to overthrow our aristocrats?" "Do you not know that they are the first among us?" "Wherefore do you place their lives on a pedestal?" Came her voice, like a fresh breeze, "If you claim to know the wind as your companion," "Then did you not once know freedom, too?" To her lonesome listeners she told a tale: A tale of our rulers' better ancestors who held divine power, A tale of angels, gods and vile dragons, A tale of the deities and peoples of all the land. Each myth and legend she turned to song, And the wind carried the song to all corners of the land. In the aristocrats' arena, her sword sang once more: Her final masterpiece, but it stopped short of perfection. A nameless knight retrieved her sword from the blood-soaked battlefield. And buried it where the gentle winds meet in communion.A legendary tale passed down by Springvale hunters that portrays an encounter between an unknown young boy and a spring fairy . Under the cascading moonlight, a tearful boy made his wish at the spring. A fairy from afar, who had taken up residence in the unoccupied spring, listened in silence to his wordless wish. Spring fairies know nothing of distant memories or deep dreams. They are born of water's essence, faceless descendants of the angels. Thus, when the curious fairy emerged from the water and heard the cry of that boy's heart, she became interested in this life, younger and more fragile than her own. The silent fairy reached out her formless fingers, cold as the midnight dew and soft as fortune forgone and gently caressed the boy's forehead and cheeks. Startled by this stranger's touch, the young boy lifted his head and met the fairy's gaze. "Can you make my wish come true?" The boy asked. The fairy of the spring was surprised and confused by this presumptuous question. But she could not speak, and so simply nodded her head. Satisfied, the boy left. He did not know that the spring fairy was alone, without friends or family, and that she had lost a great deal of her wisdom. Only when the spring water flowed from cracks in the stone into her pool, and when she gazed upon the fractured image of the moon in the rippling water, did she slowly regain the ability to think, and to mimic fragments of speech. Like a curious child, the fairy observed the world around her in innocence, wonder, and love. She rejoiced with the fox and squirrel who stole berries, and grieved at the dark clouds that covered the horizon. And for that young boy, a feeling complex yet immature welled forth from within her heart. All alone in this world, she had neither the power nor wisdom with which to grant his wish. But she could share it, and she drew life from sharing his burdens. Vol. 2 A legendary tale passed down by Springvale hunters that recounts the acquaintance of a spring fairy and a young boy. As he gazed at the fractured image of the moon carried by the water's ripples, the boy poured his heart out to the spring. From within his words, she learned much of him. And from her silence, he strengthened his belief in himself. Dimly, the spring fairy understood that there was good in the world beyond moonlight and fruits, and more to darkness than mere clouds. The boy spoke to her of forests and trees, cities and walls, and shared with her his joys, his sorrows and his fears. As she listened to him, she became enamored of this imperfect world into which she had been born. When the boy grew frustrated at his powerlessness, the spring fairy would gently and quietly wipe away his tears. From them, she grew to understood the world outside the spring a little more. Those tears flowed into the water, and the fairy purified them, turning them into a sweet nectar that brought him sweet dreams. The boy forgot the pain of his waking hours, and met the silent fairy by her spring in his sleep. Every time that happened, the fairy too would smile, asleep in the pool drenched in moonlight. The fresh dew nourished the boy's dreams, and the boy's dreams rejuvenated the lonely fairy's soul. In those dreams, the spring fairy told the boy tales of the faraway realm of Hydro . She spoke of her sapphire-blue homeland, she sang of the homesickness of exile, and she sighed for separation and belonging. In these dreams, the boy became the one who silently listened, who wept for her troubles, and who rejoiced in her happiness. Over time, the spring fairy gained the power of speech from the boy's memories and dreams. Over time, they became friends who shared all. Vol. 3 A legendary tale passed down by Springvale hunters that recounts a promise made between a spring fairy and a young boy. When the wind ceased to blow, the moon's fractured reflection in the pool was made whole, and the boy heard the fairy's voice for the first time. Fairies are tender, sensitive beings beyond the ken of humans, and the boy was deeply taken by her gentle, elegiac voice. But fairies being tender and sensitive beyond human ken, through his eyes she saw his naked yearning, and the promise that was about to leave his lips. And suddenly, the fairy was afraid. Mortal lives are strong but fleeting, and the boy must grow, and grow old. Once youth and innocence had faded, how would he treat his elemental descendants? In the twilight of his life, would he blame himself for throwing his life away for a childish promise? The spring fairy was pure and kind but she did not understand human love. She had never seen the miracle of humanity, and had merely sat idle through millennia of change. And so, she greatly feared parting. What humans see as the miracle of devotion, elemental fairies can only perceive as fleeting pleasure. And even the power of fairies cannot reverse the aging of a loved one. The tender fairy could not bear to see that unavoidable day come, and with a kiss she stopped the boy from uttering the words. But the boy, in his innocence, mistook her rejection as her approval of his promise. From that moment, the fairy vowed that she would someday bear to leave him. And the boy vowed that he would remain by her spring forever. Vol. 4 A legendary tale passed down by Springvale hunters that recounts a bitter ending finally faced by a boy who was no longer young and a spring fairy who had not grown old. By and by, the young boy grew up, made new friends and had new experiences. And the spring fairy, as she had in his youth, sang him her quiet elegies each one. Till the day came at last, when she left, and gazed no more upon the boy. Never again did words flow forth from the trickling sound of the spring. Never again would the fractured moon become whole. The spring fairy suddenly realized that though she had found a place to belong, and though she had experienced fleeting happiness, she was still alone. The boy, now no longer a boy, could not perceive her flight, and blamed himself for his own solitude. "Perhaps she was merely a childish fantasy." He would think this to himself as he listened to the gurgling of the spring. But that cool kiss was real, as was the wind that once played with her hair. Suddenly, he realized that though he had met and parted with countless new friends, and though he had adventured and returned more times than he could remember, he was still alone in the end. So, as they had done many years ago, the boy's tears fell into the pure pond, soaking into the fractured moon. But this time, the spring fairy did not come as promised. Stubbornly she turned her back, willing to be the object of an innocent childhood dream, to be a fleeting guest wandering from a foreign land, but unwilling to allow her near-eternal life to break her lover's promise. Legend has it that whenever the rain pours down, the raindrops that fall into the pond mix with the tears of the spring fairy. To his dying day, the boy believed wholeheartedly in this groundless superstition. But sadly, the spring fairy who fled from her true feelings could never believe it herself.The legendary tale of an anonymous seafarer set in a time when Liyue was plagued by sea monsters. —Rising Tide— As the moon hung bright among the sea of stars above, hums of a sea shanty slowly began to rise over the waters below. There once was a mighty ship that would lay anchor in Liyue Harbor. Its captain was a man who tracked and hunted terrible monsters of the deep, known as the " Skipper ". The ships hull was adorned with skeletons of monsters from the sea, an unmistakable signal of their Skipper's fearless will. However, the shanties of the crew seldom made any mention of hunting creatures of the deep. It's not that the sailors didn't revel in their reputation and brag of their achievements, but ages of navigating the merciless seas had taught them that ballads of blood and water were the most unlucky of all. With his sword in hand, the Skipper sailed across the watery expanse, coasting along rocky reefs and cruising with surging undercurrents. He fearlessly guided his ship to face the roar of squalls and sea monsters alike. The dark worlds that laid beneath murky waters were like boundless hunting grounds. Any monster that would dare stir the tranquil waters often became the next trophy hanging from the side of the ship. But the Skipper only knew wind and waves, and never seemed to grasp the bittersweet lives of ordinary people. For he occupied all his days with searching and hunting, accompanied solely by the salty sea breeze and the muffled calls of whales in the deep. The crew feared him more than they adored him, ever cautious of his character, relentless as if trying to break free from tangles of seaweed. The Skipper's clipper silently sailed forward, unyielding to the perilous stretches of sea. Only the young maiden who always sat atop the towering bow could ever reveal a glimmer of softness to the Skipper's eyes. She was his navigator, charmed by the tidal song and humming with the whales, guiding the ship through the wind and waves to waters infested by beasts. A young maiden at the helm offered her songs to the sea, paying due respect to its every billow and breeze... "Hark the calls of creatures deep, and echoes of waves tossed in the gale. When the sea and winds flow in our favor, towards the horizon shall we sail." "May the deities that have passed, and me ol' captain too, Steer our bow through the boundless sea, and point our compass true. May we guide every sailor's soul, to the port they call home." The chorus of the shanty gave way to the bellowing orders of the Skipper, promptly calling all hands to set sail. The mighty vessel slowly left the port and came underway, sinking into the horizon under the first glimmer of dawn. This is how the story of every voyage would begin, just as they had each day before. Vol. 2 To the never-ending tune of the ocean, the seafarer fought against the phenomenal foe of fate, fighting to the bitter end... —Wild Storm— "Come with me into the watery abyss, listening to murmurs of the deep. When the wind and waves are right, we sail towards maelstroms of the sea. I hear the jabber of me ol' lady, wishing well to her heirs to come: May they navigate blasting winds and o'er dancing waves, Pierced by heroes' harpoons, may the monster's lair meet the last of its days." Even in the most violent of squalls, her constant shanties never ceased. The voice of the maiden harmonized with the raging waves, guiding the Skipper over deathly currents, sailing boldly towards the eye of the storm where the sea monster lay lurking. Skimming across the vortex, ushered by lightning and waterspouts, the ship inched further into the monster's treacherous waters. Flashes of lightning revealed the Skipper's silhouette, fearlessly grasping his sword. Following the Skipper's fixed gaze, the crew could only make out an alpine shape shadowed by tenebrous clouds. The massive figure that lay skulking in the distance was the body of the beast. The once fearsome skeletons that hung from the ship now seemed like mere cubs compared with the terrifying silhouette that lay sprawling before them like a mountain range in the center of the maelstrom. At the Skipper's bellowing command, the crew fired broadside after broadside of giant crossbows, unleashing their mortal fears and delusions on the massive body that lay like a towering wall before them. The barrages of cannonballs and barbed iron harpoons left gruesome wounds on the body of the beast. The sea monster hissed violently in pain, plunging beneath the huge crimson waves before slamming the ship's hull with all its might. The ship nearly capsized against the might of the blow, and crimson waves came crashing across the decks. The sailors were drenched in the foul torrents as they cursed the gods of the elements and continued to rake the body of the beast with stones and sharpened spears. The ruthless Skipper never flinched at the opponents dealt to him by fate. The thundering roars of the terrible beast were answered by songs of the young maiden atop the bow. The ship maneuvered round the monster, cruising upon the spinning torrents, and answering sharp fangs and swiping stingers with catapults, harpoons, slings, and even mortal bodies to vent their dread and fury. Once the monster's body was riddled with wounds and nearly all its tentacles and claws had been severed, the Skipper's ship too had been reduced to a floating hulk. Half of the ship's masts had fallen, half of its guns were out of action, and half the crew had been taken as dinner for the monster xe2x80x93 even the Skipper's prized sword had been cleaved in two. This was an unwinnable bout, much like a mere child challenging a full-grown adult. The injured monster knew very well that its opponent no longer posed any threat. Craving to devour the ship that now lay dead in the water, it rose to the surface and exposed its gaping mouth. Vol. 3 Finally, when the tempest eased and the ocean sufrace was tranquil once more, the soft wind played a poignant homecoming tune... —Receding Torrent— Although the moon was veiled by dark clouds, her shanty did not cease. As the surface grew eerily calm amidst the storm, the splintered ship drifted slowly towards the abyss. The monster's massive spiraling mouth lay open wide, and a rumbling growl came from deep within it. The monster was content with its prey and opened its eyelids, crusted in reef and coral, to witness the final moments of yet another opponent who had underestimated it. The monster's massive eyes revealed their fragile gaze to the dying Skipper. The monster revealed in the moment and through his pair of eyes beheld a heart that was darker than the abyss. A final bolt of lightning flashed in the sky above, illuminating the ship as it split into two among the monster's swirling fangs, fading beneath a mist of splinters. Even the screams from the keel were drowned beneath the waves. And then it was dark again... until the furious roar of the monster broke out over the black waters once more. The Skipper plunged his severed sword into the eye of the beast again and again, until he was immersed beneath the filthy tide, when finally his broken sword became lodged in the monster's soft eyeball. As the Skipper drew closer to his treacherous fate, clutched by countless claws and pincers, he continued fighting tooth and nail until the monster's sharp claws were torn into pieces... A familiar tune then filled the salty breeze as the monster's movements began to cease. "Sing with me, farewell to the sea, a shanty I hold so dear, When the sea and winds flow in our favour, I know my end is near. Ol' captain is calling me name, back to whence I came, So forget not the captain and I, and hum this melody again. There will come a day when at last you find me, slumbering in the abyssal deep... Or perhaps you too then, will be swallowed by the whirlpool in the sea." The monster's gigantic tentacles burst forth from the water, snaking upwards like towering columns, but the young maiden simply lay there floating on her back, singing amidst the turmoil. Even as the tentacles coiled tightly around her arms, even as the sharp claws pierced her skin, and even as they shredded her clothing to pieces, leaving it floating in tatters on the sea, still she continued to sing her farewell shanty towards the Skipper. Then, the maiden was gently pulled into the black sea by the monster. In an age where the sea was ruled by unpredictable disasters the people of the waves die each passing day. The Skipper awoke to find himself on the deck of some unknown merchant ship. Having lost his ship and entire crew, all he had left was a body covered in wounds and an old dream echoing an ethereal sea shanty. "When the sea and winds are right, I will go forth to sea and avenge her, O maiden charmed by the tidal song..."When a small-town boy looking to leave his sleepy hometown behind gets lost in a bamboo forest at sundown, what long-forgotten dreams will he encounter? Between the rustling emerald curtain of foliage, in a spot where the croak of frogs and shrills of cicadas meet, lies a corner of the forest that is withered and dry, just near the wetlands beneath the mountain crags. The bamboo forest of Mt. Qingce is the verdant home to many fables. After a spell of rain, a cadence of drips and drops can be heard bouncing from the bamboo leaves and hollow bamboo stalks. Along a winding path between the bamboo spires came a young boy. He swiftly made his way along the trail, climbing up damp crags and running down its paved mossy course. The leaves of tangled foliage and vines strewn across his path brushed against his skin. The boy finally decided to stop for a rest at a dried and withering spot among the creaking bamboo of Mt. Qingce, tucked away below the mountain rock. The boy clearly remembered the village elder once saying that the rainy season was the proper time for the fox to take its fox wife. Only eyes of a child could ever see the fox bride's crimson sedan chair and its procession dancing through the forest accompanied by strains of music and thumping drums. The village elder also warned that kids mustn't approach near any such procession. "If you wander too close, the fox will snatch your soul away!" That's what the village elder always said. "What happens if your soul gets snatched?" asked one of the kids. "Once the fox has your soul, your fate will be forever sealed... Perhaps they will use you for music in their processions, smashing you like a cymbal and beating you like a drum, horns blaring all around... There will be no rest for your soul." The elder would never forget to pose as if she were beating a drum, scaring all the little ones. As the boy grew older, he stopped believing the elder's silly fables. Following the Seelie 's wispy trails, he passed through the green labyrinth, accompanied by the faint calls of foxes coming from the thickets along the way. Those crafty creatures hiding deep in the forest will seldom reveal themselves or their boisterous bridal processions to careless treading travelers. The boy was feeling quite low in spirit, kicking pebbles off the road and stomping up the seemingly unnatural stairways along the way, wandering further into the heart of the bamboo forest. The village elder once said that this very forest was once an ancient kingdom conquered by the Geo Archon . But what did the Geo Archon look like? Did it have arms and legs, or eyes like us? Or, was he more like the stone beasts found along the water banks? The herb gatherers that periodically set up shop in the city to sell their herbal ingredients would always bring tales of the year's Rite of Descension . Listening to their stories, one could only imagine the amazing scene of the Geo Archon descending to the world. But of course, the curious kids could only hope to someday see the great Archon that had been revered for generations with their very own eyes. Was the immovable Mt. Qingce a gift from the benevolent Geo Archon? Or were the decades of peaceful living that which had already been ordained by the Archon? The answers to these questions lay outside the village, within the aging forest on the mountain. Bubbling with questions and expectation, the determined boy made his way forward beneath the scattered shadows of bamboo leaves. Vol. 2 As the moon slowly rises in the night sky, small-town boy meets bamboo-forest girl — but is he voyaging into the realm of the adepti, or setting foot in some monstrous trap? Lost among the green bamboo canopy, the young lad soon met an unexpected companion. "What's the matter? Are you lost?" The lad heard a gentle voice among the rustling bamboo stalks, speaking with a hint of sarcastic playfulness. The lad turned to see a slender woman garbed in white. She stood beside a clear babbling brook, with beads of water glistening on her woven rush raincoat, her golden eyes melding with the rays cast through the forest by the setting sun. The village elder had said that there were once white horses that would leap from clear springs to become adepti to assist the campaigns of the Lord of Geo. But no one had ever specified which spring, or the honorable name of the illuminated beast that sprang from it. Besides, the woman that stood before him now didn't appear to be an adeptus, apart from the piercing gaze of her golden eyes. Furthermore, he had never heard of any adepti that needed to wear raincoats. "Well if it isn't another fool." The lady garbed in white began to chuckle, squinting her eyes with a smile. "Who are you calling a fool!" Replied the young lad in a fluster. This was certainly no adeptus. Who could have heard of an adeptus that would speak in such a deplorable manner? "I wish to embark on an adventure. I wish to sail across the seas and witness the stone spears of the Lord of Geo for myself!" "You've only just embarked on your journey and yet you've already fallen astray among the bamboo forest..." The woman's reply was calm and even, her eyes making a subtle smirk. The lad already found her particularly annoying. "I don't need your..." "There's no shame in being lost. Come, follow me. I will lead out of here." The woman snickered and extended her slender hand toward the boy. Her white skin glimmered under the rays of the sunset that shone between the bamboo leaves. "Uh, thank you..." The young lad took her outstretched hand. Her skin was cold and damp to the touch, much like fresh rain upon a mountain or dewdrops upon a bamboo shoot. The setting sun gradually fell behind the mountain ridge, and the afterglow in the clear above gradually began to darken. The village elder said that once the warm glow of the setting sun fades, the spirit of the mountain woods becomes a cold and murky breeding ground for monsters. These monsters are born from a past that has long gone, their spirits forming from the resentment and unwillingness of the dead. Any bamboo they ensnare by them will dry up and die, and any person they ensnare will similarly grow weary and fade from existence. "Sometimes, they will even call upon passersby to assist them with matters that they could not accomplish on their own, before leading them into a trap from which they would never return..." "Other times, they would act as a guide for innocent travelers, leading them to a den of demons." "So you see, little ones, you must stay vigilant, and never let your guard down when you journey far from familiar soil." Thus said the village elder, patting the kids on their heads as she finished the story. Come to think of it, could this woman in white be a monster of the mountain woods? The lad grew nervous in his heart and couldn't help but slow his pace. "What's the matter?" The woman turned around, her golden eyes shining through the moonlight draping over her silhouette. Vol. 3 Deep in the bamboo forest, reality has coincided with a story from the distant past. But the crossover ends as the bright moon reaches its peak in the night sky, and small-town boy disappears into an indescribable dream. Nightfall seemed to always hasten its approach over the bamboo forest of Mt. Qingce. Gazing upward, the silvery moonlight was scattered amidst the shadows of the bamboo forest's leaves. In a spot illuminated under the moonlight, far from the croaking frogs and chirping cicadas, new bamboo culms had just sprouted from the ground. The bamboo forest of Mt. Qingce is the verdant home to many fables. As night fell, the woman garbed in white began to recount many stories to the young lad, ancient tales that the lad had never heard before. "Long ago, three bright moons once hung high in the night sky. These three moons were sisters, their years numbering more than those of the Geo Archon and their year of birth predating the very bedrock upon which Liyue Harbor now rests. The moons were daughters of prose and song, sovereign over the night sky. They navigated the heavens above in their silver carriage, alternating with one another thrice a month. If the reign was not promptly passed from one sister to the next, a terrible disaster would occur that very day. &#91; Note 1 &#93; These three luminous moons shared but one love, the stars of daybreak. Only at the fleeting moments when day and night converged could one of the three sisters pass the fading stars and gaze upon the chambers of the morning stars. Moments later, as the new dawn would break over the horizon, the carriage would quickly ferry the night's sister away. The three sisters shared an equal affection for their one and only love, much like the affection they shared for one another. But this was all before the world was smashed against the tides of great calamity . With time, disasters overturned the sovereign carriage and laid ruin to the halls of the stars. The three sisters of the night turned against one another, leading to their eternal parting by death. Only one of their pale corpses now remains, ever shedding its cold light..." The woman raised her head and gazed at the moon though the sea of bamboo. Her long, slender neck was covered in the silver light and her eyes shone gold. "The wolf packs are children of the moons, they remember the calamities and the tragedies that ensued. Hence, they lament the fate of their mother with each new moon... It is also why those who live among the wolves call the morning stars, the surviving love of the moon, the grievous stars." "I see..." The young lad remained silent for some time. This was a story that the village elders had never told them before. Perhaps it was a legend that even the eldest of elders had never heard before. Such stories were much more grand than those about foxes taking brides and monsters ensnaring people, but less riveting than the tales of the Lord of Geo driving away evil spirits. The woman's tales were almost like a dream of the imagination. "These are stories that have never been told, legends that have already been long forgotten by people." The woman garbed in white gently stroked the lad's hair and lowered her eyelids. The golden color of her eyes grew a bit darker. "Before the ancient immortals established the universe, there were gods that wandered across the lands. It was at this time that many of the adepti came into being. But what about before then?" &#91; Note 2 &#93; "Only broken memories and fragments of the past were turned into stories, and stories turned into legends, passed down among the people..." "Even deities and adepti would feel sentimental upon hearing such ancient memories that surpass the mortal world." The woman let out a long sigh and turned to find the young lad fast asleep. "Tsk! Unbelievable..." With a helpless smile, she took off her raincoat and placed it over the young lad. That night, the lad dreamt of three moons in the sky, and a silver carriage stopped before the gates of the stars. Vol. 4 As dawn gently approaches, the fate of the two youngsters diverges, and they go their separate ways. But the echoes of that ancient story still resound within the forest, waiting for the day that they may welcome small-town boy back into their midst once more. As day, slowly dawned, the young boy was gently awakened. Daybreak's light silhouetted the white mist that shrouded the bamboo forest of which tales of ghostly foxes were told, and they seemed like horsetails as they billowed this way and that. The woman held his hand, and together they walked toward the place where the sun pierced through the woods. They turned left, then right, passing through undergrowth teeming with insects, clambering over slippery moss-covered stones, scaling down a gorge hidden by the shadows of the bamboo trees. All the way she led him, till they arrived at the exit of the bamboo forest. "I still don't know who you are, or where you're from." Said the boy, for the previous night's story had yet to leave his mind. "..." The woman turned, and with her back to the morning light, her eyes shone gold. But she merely smiled, and said nothing. Many years later, the boy who was a boy no longer would remember that moment, and he would understand: the gap between them was as a yawning chasm. His fate was to leave his home and go to Liyue Harbor, to seek the riches the Geo Archon had bestowed upon him. Hers, then, was to hide herself away, away from the majestic, kindly gaze of that great Lord of Geo, and protect those ancient tales that even she was beginning to forget. So, the boy and the white-clad, golden-eyed woman were parted. He would pack his things and head for that thriving port city, while she stood silently at the boundaries of the bamboo forest. For in her bewitching eyes she seemed to have already foreseen the young man's fate — that someday, when he was old, tired of the sea and the waves of life, he would slowly return to this mountain village, and there he would live out the rest of his days. In the dawn's glow, the boy heard a whinnying cry that then grew distant. He turned and looked, and there was nothing behind him, but a single strand of hair that had come to rest on his shoulder.

of many popular tales told of Mondstadt's drinkers. This one is the story of a drunkard who stumbled into wolven territory and the lone, starving wolf he encountered there. In the land where the dandelion wine flows like a river, tall tales have a way of spreading far and wide, following closely in the wake of the whiff of wine. Far-fetched fables are always sure to spread when boasted between burps by inebriated bar patrons. For these stories share something in common with the slurred speech and sea-sickness-inducing swaying that so often accompanies them, which is that despite being clumsy and awkward, they are also highly entertaining. Legend has it that there was once a famous drunkard in Mondstadt. It was said that he could hold his alcohol as well as any hunter from Springvale in the off season. And yet, still he would drink till he was drunk, every time that he drank, he would not budge so much as an inch back from the bar at the tavern until not a single Mora was left in his coin pouch, and not a single drop of wine remained in his glass. One night, this drunkard was doing his best to stumble home after a particularly satisfying session of especially heavy drinking. A combination of his spinning head, blurred vision, and zigzagging stride served to navigate him towards a forest populated by wolves. Today, of course, Wolvendom is presided over by the Great Wolf King of the North , and the ominous atmosphere that emanates from inside the forest is sufficient to deter most sober-headed visitors from approaching the area. According to the elderly hunters, the Wolf King gathered the spirits of the wolves there to prevent outsiders from trespassing into territory where they are not welcome. But this was an age long before the Wolf King and the north wind had descended upon that forest, bringing order and peace to the wolven race. At that time, the forest was a perilous place where wild wolves fought for survival. A fierce blood feud between wolves played out deep inside the dense foliage, concealed from view and unbeknownst to any man. Least of all to the drunkard, who had by this point managed to transport his drunken self quite some distance inside the forest. He stumbled forward in the darkness with that dogged determination that only drunkards possess, deterred neither by the tree roots that would trip him up every few steps, nor by the stray branches that would slyly slap him in the face from time to time. Before long, a pair of green eyes began darting through the forest, their gaze fixed on him, tracking his every move. Those eyes belonged to a lone wolf, who silently pursued the drunkard from behind, all the while musing to itself: "This is the most peculiar sight I have ever seen in all my life." No one had dared set foot in the wolves' forest in hundreds of years, be they a knight clad top to toe in shining steel armor or a desperate fugitive dressed in rags. Even the callous nobles refused to exile their slaves there, for fear of inciting the wrath of the wild wolves and bringing unwanted trouble to their own territory. "And yet, this odd fellow dares to stroll in here all by himself. How very strange indeed!" The lone wolf pondered this strange phenomenon as it followed the drunken intruder through the forest, doing its best to ignore the stench of alcohol that was wafting its way. Vol. 2 One of many Mondstadt tales told of popular drinkers. This story is the one of the time a lone, starving wolf met a drunken Mondstadt man. It is a well-known fact that wolves have a far keener sense of smell than humans. Another way of putting this is that their noses are much more sensitive. Little wonder, then, that the stench of alcohol emanating from the wolf's now historically intoxicated prey was quite stifling, and caused tears to well up in its eyes. "Awoo..." the wolf thought to itself. Having been born in the wilderness and grown up in the forest, the wolf had never had any contact with human civilization before this night, and though it had once caught the faint scent of wine wafting across Cider Lake , it did not know the scent's origin, less still understand the significance of that substance to human kind. "Perhaps this peculiar fellow is a relative of the skunk, for it seems that he discovered my presence quite some time ago, and now means to poison me in an effort to secure his escape!" The wolf pondered this possibility as it braced itself against the onslaught of alcoholic fumes, picked up its pace, and discreetly maneuvered its way into the drunkard's shadow — the perfect vantage point from which to inspect its prey. The wolf is a creature of caution and calculation. The drunkard, meanwhile, is a different sort of creature entirely. And yet, though wine tends to dizzy the mind and dull the senses, it sometimes affords its consumers the curious capacity to detect the subtlest of changes in the direction of the wind. Perhaps this could explain how a bumbling drunkard, fumbling through the forest, was suddenly able to discover the presence of a wolf that had been stealthily following him the entire time. Or perhaps the alcoholic fumes given off by the drunkard were sufficiently potent to diminish the wolf's mental acuity, to the point that the wolf became less mindful of the terrain beneath its paws, the resulting sound of snapping twigs thus alerting the prey to the predator's presence. "Who's that? Don't s'pose you know which way the toilet is, by any chance...?" The bumbling drunkard rubbed his bleary eyes. "Foul-smelling human," snarled the wolf, "Who are you, and whence proceeds your stench?" The wolf flared its nostrils, bored its fangs, and growled. Not only was the drunkard unafraid when he heard the wolf's gruffly voiced threat, but he even became quite animated. "My friend!" the drunkard replied, "Clearly I've offended you, somehow... sorry 'bout that... but anyway, Mondstadt tradition says you're not allowed to be drunk and bored at the same time... So! Here we are, out in the woods on this glorious moonlit night... How abouts I tell you a story?" His proposal was promptly punctuated by an almighty belch. Before this point, the wolf had had no intention of listening to the belching buffoon's drunken ramblings. In fact, it was poised to deliver a fatal blow to its prey by lunging for the neck, sinking its fangs in, and tearing his throat clean out. But the drunkard's belch blasted a further bout of fumes in the wolf's direction, assailing its nostrils with such force that it ruined the wolf's appetite entirely. Grudgingly, the wolf agreed. "Grr... Perhaps I'm not so hungry after all... Let's see what nonsense tale you have to tell." The drunkard stretched out his arms and let out a loud yawn, disturbing a few dandelions in the process. And with that, the drunkard began to tell his tale. Vol. 3 One of the popular, many tales told by the drinkers of Mondstadt. This drunkard is the one who told the lone wolf of an ancient story. Legend tells of a lone wolf that roamed a barren wasteland far, far away. Once, he had been king of his pack, leading them in the hunt, in battle, and in the search for a home... Now, the sole remaining legacy of those days were the scars that covered his body. He has led the way as they ran across open plains, navigated through abandoned ruins, and passed through the domains of monsters and the Seelie . The wasteland was a cruel place. The wolf-king grew older with each passing day, and the other wolves gradually dispersed. As time went by, the wolf pack's history faded into distant memory, until finally only the aged wolf-king remained, the sole survivor of its pack. This wasteland is said to be a land beyond the dominion of the deities, inhabited only by the grotesque ghostly remains of fallen gods, where the former palaces of the Seelie now stand empty. &#91; Note 1 &#93; So when the solitary old wolf passed by a gray palace and heard the sound of music coming from within, it caught its attention. "Never before have I heard a sound so pleasing to the ears, whether it be a song of bird or insect, that it stays the pangs of hunger in my starved stomach as this tune does." Intrigued, the wolf stepped inside the gray hall, trod across the overgrown weeds, and passed by a broken sarcophagus, on which a portrait of the deceased ruler was still clearly visible. Finally, he came to an inner room, where he saw a fair maiden strumming at her instrument. Her skin was ashen white and her head was bowed down, her slender fingers gently stroking the fragile strings of the lute as she played a long-forgotten and mournful melody. The wolf sat down in front of the pale young maiden and forgot all about the pain of hunger, thirst, and loneliness for a short while, as it listened in silence to her song. "The chirping of insects on a long-gone autumn night is the chorus of exiles, singing mankind's most ancient song as they live out their plight..." "Stripped of all that the body once held close and the soul once held dear, song and memories are all that now remain of yesteryear." "The last singers, the first Seelie, they played their final tune in the halls of angels." The tiny Seelie playing in the forest were also drawn to the young maiden's tune, and flocked to her to pay their respects. "What is this song that you play?" The wolf asked, puzzled, for it understood every line, every word, every syllable she spoke — and yet, hers was a language that it had never heard before, quite unlike that of any other living being. "A song of the Seelie,"Replied the pale young maiden in a soft voice. "Long, long ago, we wrote this song for the human savages. Yet now, we sing it to mourn our own fate." The wolf began to sing along, albeit clumsily, to the maiden's tune. The wolf's voice was husky and broken, filled with a lifetime of sorrow. "What are you singing?" The maiden asked of the wolf. "This is our song," Responded the wolf. "It sounds ghastly." The maiden made no attempt to soften her criticism as she continued to caress the lute strings. "But, you are welcome to sing along with me all the same." And so, a shared chorus sung by fair young maiden and weary old wolf filled the chambers of the long-abandoned palace. It is said that to this day, adventurers who pass by this place still hear a strange yet harmonious melody sounding from within. "And then? ...The story ends here?" The wolf licked its lips, somewhat ruefully, and then said: "I suppose I shall tell you a story now." And with that, the wolf cleared its throat and began to tell its tale. Vol. 4 One of many drinking tales popularly told in Mondstadt. This wolf told a tale of wine and wolf to a drunken man of Mondstadt. Legend has it that the first wine of Mondstadt was brewed in the age when the north wind howled. In the age when the Kings of Ice and Frost fought for dominion , Mondstadt's forbears brewed rudimentary wine from wild fruits, even as they shivered in the biting cold. They did so to ease the pain of their frostbitten fingers and to give them the courage to face the harsh and unforgiving ice. For at that time, the land of Mondstadt was engulfed by ice and snow, and the dandelions had not yet reared their heads. It is said that the first person in Mondstadt to discover the craft of wine brewing was a grossly negligent guard. In a tribe beset by blizzards on all sides, it was the unenviable job of the hardy hunter-gatherers to stock the storage pits with food, and it was the guard's task to guard against intruders. The sight of a human intruder was a rare one indeed in that harsh environment — but there were other creatures who could better withstand the cold, and they would burrow underground to reach the food stocks. The rules of the tribe were that one person should inspect the storage pits at all times, filling in any mouse holes discovered — or better still, catching them red-handed in the act of pilfering — to keep the tribe's food supplies at plentiful levels. At that time, the damp, dark caves needed constant care and attention to prevent the food they held from going bad and rotting. On top of this, the mischievous little creatures that hid away out of sight would sometimes play pranks on the guards. One day, a wily wind spirit noticed that the grossly negligent guard was once again being grossly negligent. So, the spirit took the form of a fox and crept into a pile of wild apples. There, it caused yeast to grow, ripening the apples and causing them to ferment. The grossly negligent guard was ravenous when he returned, and elected to partake of one of the apples. The mellow taste of fermented fruit delighted both his body and his mind. Immediately, he took animal hide and squeezed the juice from the apples, creating wine. The grossly negligent guard who first invented brewing in the age of ice and snow also became Mondstadt's first drunkard. It is said he was the first person ever to fall into a drunken dream. In his first drunken dream, he drunkenly dreamt that he had become a lone wolf. Somewhere in the long-lost past or possibly the far-flung future, he fought fang and claw with rival wolf packs, battled with humans for food in the midst of a raging snowstorm, and met the first Seelie. The tribe-dwelling human and the pack-dwelling wolf could not bear to live in solitude. This newly brewed wine served to bring man and wolf together in their dreams. But their attitudes towards these dreams were poles apart. The human who knew only the wind and snow yearned for the wasteland where the lone wolf runs freely, but the lone wolf was fearful of the human's desire. It could not understand why this human was captivated by dangerous illusions and sought hope from within them. What concerned the wolf even more was that when in a drunken human dream, it could no longer distinguish whether it was a wolf or a human with a wolven spirit. So the wolf swore an oath never to touch the humans' poison again, to resist the allure of wine. Wolves are not the children of the wind, and the land of wine and song is not their home. So the wolves left the humans' domain and settled far off in the wilderness and deep in the mountain forests, places where the scent of wine could not reach them. "What you humans call wine, we wolves call the abyss," The wolf haughtily concluded. But as the wolf turned towards the drunkard to say this line, it discovered that the drunkard was now lying fast asleep on a bed of pine branches. The wolf was most displeased, and violently expelled a puff of air from its nostrils before leaving the still-pungent pile of sleeping human to his business, and going on its way.A Liyue fantasy novel that tells the tales of Rex Lapis ' incognito excursions in the mortal realm. Set in an age when the treasures of the world flocked forth, fact merges with fiction and both blend with old dreams in this charming tale set in the commercial port of Liyue . Liyue is a land where all kinds of rare and exotic treasures congregate, and where there are precious treasures, one is sure to also find those with discerning eye. The very first owner of Xigu Antiques — the unconventional collector, Min'gui — was just such an individual. Xigu Antiques of Feiyun Slope was frequented by well-to-do customers. Closed during daylight hours, it only opened to customers once the moon began to rise in the night sky. The shop's customers were anything but ordinary: they were the wealthy and leisurely, people with outstanding taste. A meticulously crafted timepiece from Fontaine, incense from Sumeru, a wine goblet once owned by an aristocrat of old Mondstadt, a wooden stool whose surface was once graced by the buttocks of an adeptus for all of one hour, a delicate jade teacup from which the Lord of Geo once supped a sip of tea, a priceless celadon vase that Liyue's neighbor deity, the Anemo Archon, once accidentally knocked the to the ground, shattering it to pieces... All these and more where laid out for the customers to peruse at their leisure, each item just waiting for that one person with whom it shared a certain affinity. One night, a wealthy young man who was walking by happen to pause in front of the shop, and began carefully examining the items on the shelves. The owner was struck by his long, black robes, dark and solemn as the looming mountain peaks, and by his eyes, which were the color of amber. This was no ordinary young man. This Min'gui could tell with one look. "Welcome to Xigu Antiques," she said. "Please peruse at your leisure, and let me know if you find something you like." Her soft voice broke the dead silence of the night. "Ah...? Oh, I'm sorry." The young man smirked, and spoke in a subtly coy manner. "I'm just rather taken with this exquisite counterfeit." The item that had caught his eye was a damaged jade plaque. The face exposed to the night sky was the one on which the pattern was slightly more intact, and as the moonlight shone down, it seeped into the intricate blemishes in the jade, exposing them, and cascaded down the ravines produced by the crisscrossing texture on the plaque's surface. The severe wear and tear on the front and the disintegration around the perimeter made it impossible to discern the words and images that had once been written on it. By all accounts, it seemed to have lived a turbulent life. "Counterfeit, you say? What makes you so sure?" Min'gui was quite used to customers making such provocative claims. But this young man spoke so bluntly and bitingly that she could not help but feel aggravated by his accusation. Added to this was the fact that this particular item had been snagged by an adventurer from an abandoned palace deep in the heart of the abyss, who had then barely made it back out of that place alive, She recalled how she had haggled relentlessly with the adventurer to acquire the piece, and how in the end it had still cost her the better part of her fortune. If this truly was nothing more than a counterfeit, not only would it imply that she had lost an immense portion of her wealth, but it would also mean irrevocable damage to the reputation of Xigu Antiques as connoisseurs of quality. Min'gui knew what she had to do: Not only must she somehow get rid of this calamitous customer who threatened to ruin her entire business, but she must also find a way to sell this jade plaque to him in the process. "Please, continue," she said. "I would hope that you can give a detailed appraisal." ———————— "As we all know, Teyvat was plunged into chaos two and a half millennia ago when the gods declared war on each other, the ensuing conflict spreading to all people in all corners of the land. Teyvat may not have been divided into the same seven nations we know today back in that age, but then, just as now, the people had their own settlements, cities and civilizations..." "Gods whose names have now long since been forgotten were once venerated, worshiped, even adored by their people. Our forebears took pearls and shells from the sea, jade from the mountains, rocks from the plains, and salt crystals from the earth, each to build idols in form of their gods. "Jade plaques of this kind are relics of that era. They belonged to an ancient tribe who worshiped Rex Lapis... though, of course, the Geo Lord probably did not yet go by the name Rex Lapis at that time." "This was an age where people watched their gods clash in bitter battles before their very eyes. Rex Lapis would not establish the currency of the seven nations and cast the first Mora coins for quite some time. So the tribes traded using pieces of ore they would chance across from time to time, with idols made in the likeness of the Geo Lord to ensure price stability." "As you can see... Mortal wisdom is quite a fascinating thing. They were making their own way in the world even before Rex Lapis had made provisions for them to do so." The young man paused as if to further contemplate the observation he had just made. He stood there, cloaked in a veil of silver moonlight, which somehow served to make him every so slightly more diminutive in stature. "This type of jade plaque is a rare find in this day and age. Most of them are buried in riverbeds up in the mountains. And since each one is hand carved, they are all unique... That is why they typically sell for astronomical prices. To claim that they are priceless would not be an exaggeration." "So, it is quite a shame indeed that the one you display on your shelf is a recent counterfeit. By recent, I mean that it was probably made in your father's generation at the earliest." "There is an industry saying, 'the jade without blemish is no jade at all.' This jade, for instance, has remarkably few imperfections, and the translucency is too good to be true... All of which points to the fact that it is unlikely to be a product of our forebears' making." "As a side point, I would also add that the image carved onto this jade is that of a woman. This is a highly unusual thing to see among similar relics from the era in question." The young man held the plaque up to the moonlight to inspect it in more detail. "Although there are plenty of rumors to this effect, the claim that Rex Lapis once took the form of a woman is not attested to by any of the historical records, and there is no physical evidence of it ever occurring..." Though young, the man had the air of an old and infuriating pedant about him. "Ah, well this is where you're wrong..." Min'gui smiled faintly, much as a fox does when toying with an inexperienced hunter. "Perhaps you'd be willing to listen to my story before making your final verdict?" The shop owner narrowed her eyes and began the process of reeling out her story... Vol. 2 A Liyue fantasy novel that tells the tales of Rex Lapis' incognito excursions in the mortal realm. Between lofty mountain peaks where bounteous jade lies beneath, substantial ideas and empty lies are suddenly shown up side by side. Back in the age when the gods still walked upon the earth, the deity whom we now worship as Rex Lapis was but one among many. In those days, the rumor among the common folk was that the Lord of Geo was a cold and unfeeling god. His conduct was just in all things and his judgments were rational and dispassionate, but he lacked normal human sentiment. Like the rocks, he was without warmth or softness. Despite this, people revered and placed their faith in him all the same. This was because his laws served to guarantee that trade was fair and that life was safe and orderly. The Geo Archon grew in strength and stature because of the people's belief in him. But even gods are powerless to control the beliefs and doubts of their mortal followers. And even a god who is the guardian of justice has no means of instilling the words of his rules and regulations into the heart of every individual. In Mingyun Village there was an incorrigibly irreverent jade craftsman who loved to jest. Whatever job he took on, he would complete it in the most unorthodox means imaginable, and would always finish the job on the very last day before it was due. If the customer ordered a statue of a hunter dominating a ferocious beast, they would receive a miniature statue of a distressed boar running for its life. And when the customer demanded an explanation, he would tell them: "When a formidable hunter closes in on a fierce beast, he may not show his face, but his imposing presence is enough to frighten the beast to its core." If the customer ordered a carving in the likeness of a powerful and mighty ruler, they would probably receive a statue of a majestic throne. And when asked about it, he would reply: "No ruler takes the throne for more than one hundred years. The throne has more longevity than he." The craftsman quickly developed a reputation as an eccentric in Mingyun Village. But the wealthy merchants in the prosperous commercial port of Liyue Harbor were most amused and were only too willing to place orders with him xe3x83xbc if only to experience for themselves what it was like to be on the receiving end of this mischievous man's antics. —————— One night, a woman came to his workshop. She was dressed in a long, slender black gown and her eyes shone a brilliant amber in the light of the crescent moon hanging in Liyue's sky that night. The craftsman had never met her before, but he quickly found himself deep in conversation with her. It was strange, she seemed acquainted with every vein of ore and deposit of jade in the village. She talked about the wonders of the world like they were her sisters, and spoke of jade and precious metals with a fondness one would normally reserve for their beloved daughter... The only topics she brushed over were culture, customs, and social interactions. Perhaps she was not wise to the ways of the world, or perhaps she did not wish to discuss them. Regardless, there was certainly something out of the ordinary about this woman. At least, the craftsman thought so. "I would like for you to make me a jade plaque bearing the likeness of the Lord of Geo on its surface." The woman finally stated her request once their broad-reaching and lengthy conversation had reached its end, and she was all but ready to leave. "But I have one condition: You may not conjure up our Lord's likeness from your imagination. You must carve the true likeness of our Lord relying on what you have seen with your own two eyes." "Otherwise," she said, "I'm not paying a single Mora." And so a deal was struck between the two, with an agreed turnaround of three days. On the first day, the craftsman dined and drank with his good friends. He did not take a single new job on that day. On the second day, the craftsman climbed a mountain to view the jade there, not seeing a single customer or acquaintance for the entire day. Only on the third day did the craftsman close the doors of his workshop and begin carving away at the uncut jade, working from dawn to dusk, until finally it was complete. When the crescent moon once again began to ruse in the Liyue night sky, the amber-eyed woman returned and approached his doorstep. The craftsman proudly handed over the fruits of his labor: A jade plaque bearing the likeness of their god, in female form. The woman was puzzled. She frowned, and demanded an explanation. And this was the explanation that he gave: "On the first day, I sought counsel from every wise and learned person that I know, and learned the principles of our Lord and how they work. But this was just the skeleton." "On the second day, I visited the mountains and spent a whole day observing the mountain rocks, listening to the ebb and flow of the elements, and pondering all that our Lord had created. But this was just the flesh." "On the third day, I covered both my eyes and began to carve from the heart, starting when it felt like the time to start, stopping when it felt like the time to stop. At last, this was the spirit." The craftsman smiled awkwardly, then added: "But even I'm not sure why it came out like this." The woman tilted the item back and forth in her hand, as if contemplating something. "Interesting," she finally responded. "Incidentally, this reminds me of another story..." She looked up at him with her amber-colored eyes and began the process of reeling out her story... Vol. 3 A Liyue fantasy novel that tells the tales of Rex Lapis' incognito excursions in the mortal realm. Iron-clad concepts of rules or equity fade into nothingness in this fantastical tale. Liyue is a land where all kinds of rare and exotic treasures congregate, and where there are precious treasures, one is sure to also find those with a discerning eye. At the height of Liyue Harbor's prosperity, a myriad goods and treasures flowed endless in and out of the land like the rising and falling tides. That age belonged, as does the current one, to the wealthy merchants and ship owners. It was an age in which the ones who reigned supreme were those who dared wrestle with the tumultuous tides of the market and the wrathful beasts of the ocean. Likewise, then as now, the port was constantly abuzz with sailors and laborers. Legend has it that Rex Lapis, when appearing in mortal form, does not always take the form of a distinguished gentleman fraternizing with the well-to-do of Yujing Terrace. Sometimes, it is said, he takes the form of a commoner and mingles with the miners, the fishermen, the sailors, and the peddlers. Back in that day, there was a certain fishing vessel owner who was notoriously harsh and critical in his temperament. He was always rude towards those who worked for him, and whenever something wasn't to his satisfaction, he would jump to conclusions and start scolding them, even docking their wages, without giving them the opportunity to explain their side of the story. One day, the fishing vessel owner met a young man. He had just been hired by the fishing vessel owner, and his attire was indistinguishable from that of any other seafarer of the day: a loose-fitting brown shirt and trousers, and a bandana around his forehead. But from his tanned skin and the rugged, karst-like contours of his facial features, it was clear that he was a commoner from Qingce Village who had come down from the mountains into the city in an attempt to reverse his fortunes. Like most mountain-dwellers of his day, he was a simple-minded and unsophisticated fellow. But what dismayed his new boss more than this was his reluctance to go anywhere near the catches of the slimy and tentacled variety. "You don't make money by being choosy! Who do you think you are, lord of the manor?" This was the only justification the ship owner gave for docking the newly hired mountain's man pay. The youngster simply smiled bashfully and continued with his work. This set the tone for many of the interactions between the two. But one day, the youngster responded instead with a question: "Everyone has likes and dislikes, so why should we do the things we hate the most?" The fishing vessel owner was taken completely by surprise by this random question. Incensed, he slapped his simpleton apprentice on the head and barked back at him: "Them's the rules of the world, you moron! Listen good: You'll get yourself nowhere in this world if you won't do a job you don't like!" "But maybe that wasn't what Rex Lapis meant when he made the rules..." "Shut up, you idiot!" "Hmm, maybe you'll understand better if I tell you a story." The young man's eyes shone like amber from the mountain mines in the light of the setting sun. "Oh? So you're a storyteller now, are you?" At the thought of this simpleton from a sleepy mountain village telling him a story, the fishing vessel owner found himself suddenly quite curious. "Go on then... But I expect you to work and talk at the same time!" A mischievous smile flickered across the youngster's face, and a twinkle flashed in his eye. "Well then, let me tell you a story about a certain jade plaque..." And so, the young man proceeded to tell his tale. His boss listened so intently that he never noticed the anonymous pair of hands that were sneaking into his pocket — hands which subsequently pilfered the money he had made from all the wages he had docked before distributing it back out to the laborers. Vol. 4 A Liyue fantasy novel that tells the tales of Rex Lapis' incognito excursions in the mortal realm. In an age of reflection on the treasures of the world, one humble witticism was all it took to expose all lies. It was a time when countless exotic curios and items would flow into Liyue Harbor. This night, Min'gui, mistress of Xigu Antiques, was researching relics and narrating ancient stories with an unnamed son of nobility. The focal point of their debate was a jade plaque. As many knew, creating a counterfeit jade item was not a matter that cost much capital in Liyue. Creating a beautiful fake might be a shade more expensive, but it was a cost that most merchant houses could absorb. The real trick lay in weaving an intricate but spurious tale. Like a jade smith wandering deep into the mountains, or the youth of the fisherfolk whose habits are strange, those considered deviant often in fact strike closer to the heart of things. Rex Lapis laid down rules and contracts, but never forced the ordinary folk by his authority to live by them as a perfect template, for he knew that laws and stipulations were a means, not the end. The timeless balance lay, in truth, in a person's awareness and their ability to make choices for themselves. The harsh boss of the fishing vessel did not understand this principle, and so earned the fear and mockery of his hired help. As humans are, so too are antiques. Artistry, quality, quality and perfection are limiting factors, yes, but the worth of a relic lies in its backstory. The picky young noble seemed not to wholly perceive this idea, and so had no qualms about calling the jade plaque a fake, denigrating its value. But if all of Xigu Antiques' treasures were to be scrutinized with such a piercing and empirical eye, their worth would have been ground into dust. Like the tears of a maiden for her captain, which became eternal pearls, or a mortal king who himself carved a portrait of his deceased queen, before sealing his own soul into it... These stories, these legends that should have faded with time were preserved, and thus teemed with life under the outer husk of those relics. "A fine story, I'll take this fake, then." The noble son nodded, his golden eyes smiling. "After all that, you still think this is a fake?" Min'gui sighed lightly. "Of course," The young noble could not help but smile, and indeed had never seemed happier since entering her shop. "After all, the story you told about jade plaques being ancient currency — it's nonsense. Nonsense that I made up."

book on the cultures and customs of Liyue originally compiled by Fadhlan , a scholar from Sumeru residing in Liyue. It was then edited by many local scholars and published. It is one of the bestsellers in Liyue. —Flower Ball— It is customary at weddings in Liyue for the bride to cast a flower ball towards the oncoming crowd of guests. It is said that the one fortunate enough to catch it will enjoy a year of good luck: business owners will see their wealth increase, the poor will see their fortunes turn around, the single will encounter their fated partners, and the married will see their shared life blossom with mutual love and appreciation, never again to descend into petty squabbles over life's daily vexations. While some brides use a real flower ball, many alternatives exist depending on the family's wealth. The rich tend to use woven balls with silk from the Silk Flower , while the poor fashion theirs from colored paper or cloth. But the custom itself is observed in the same fashion at all of Liyue's weddings, even though the fortunes of individual families may differ. Some say the Liyue custom was originally adopted from the Ludi Harpastum festival celebrated in the neighboring Wind Kingdom of Mondstadt . Others say it dates back to before the Archon War , when the Salt God roamed free in Liyue. She once stood shoulder to shoulder with the many gods of Liyue, but her extraordinarily gentle nature saw her quickly ousted in the hubris of the Archon War, before being ruthlessly murdered by one of her own followers. Her remains are likely to be found somewhere in the ruins of the area known as " Sal Terrae ." According to a legend that time has unfortunately stripped of all useful detail, she once handed out bunches of flowers to her people as a blessing to them. Or at least, if not a blessing, then a small gesture of comfort to stave off the bitterness of wartime existence. In any case, following her return to the elements, it is conceivable that her followers spread across Liyue, took this custom with them, and taught it to the locals. The people of Liyue being a competitive and fun-loving folk, they may then have adapted it and embellished upon it to suit their own preferences. Despite being a benign and joyful celebration at heart, security logs from the Millelith indicate that the throwing of flower balls is responsible for a significant number of injuries every year. In fact, the number of cases is more or less the same as those caused by monster attacks.

It is one of the bestsellers in Liyue. —Receiving God— Of all the celebrations, ceremonies, and customs of Liyue, none is more iconic than that held in reception of their god: the "Rite of Descension." It is during this rite that the Geo Archon , Liyue's deity and watchful guardian over the ages, descends in person upon the mortal realm to issue his divine proclamations and exhort the people to be guided by the wisdom they contain, so that all things may transpire in accordance with established rules instead of tending towards chaos. In the earliest and humblest days of Liyue's history, Liyue's farmer-forebears would elect community representatives to greet the Geo Archon on arrival and give him an appropriate send-off on departure. After making lavish offerings and reciting solemn blessings, they would listen in reverence to their god's divine predictions, before announcing to the people the vision for their labor in the year ahead. In this way, mortals were guided along the path towards prosperity and to triumph over the obstacles that lay in their way, and thus did the domain of the Geo Archon remain strong and steadfast. When peace returned once more after the Archon War, the city of Liyue Harbor began to flourish under the government of the Qixing , who represented every trade in Liyue, and who also acted as intermediaries between mortals and their god, taking responsibility for communicating with the Geo Archon, explaining his divine predictions to the people in clear and simple terms, and issuing the official policy for the forthcoming year. Naturally, the illustrious individual tasked with hosting the Rite of Descension can only be chosen from among the Qixing, and no one other than that person is permitted to intervene in the proceedings. In the minds of the many merchants of Liyue Harbor, the divine predictions of Rex Lapis are more precious than the metals and minerals of the mountain mines. Thus, no matter how far from home they may have strayed by the day that Rex Lapis descends, all will seek to make the journey back in person, or at least send someone in their place, so that they may receive the guidance of the Geo Archon and safeguard their financial fortunes for the year ahead. The raving-mad sages of the nation of rainforests drive themselves to hysterics as they abandon all that is worldly in their pursuit of elusive and esoteric wisdom, but the people of the land of karst cliffs are accustomed to welcoming the generous guidance of their deity as a means towards a worldly end — namely, their continued prosperity. It would seem that, while The Seven stand shoulder-to-shoulder in their roles as Archons of the mortal realm, there are moments where their paths diverge, and even run directly counter to one another.

It is one of the bestsellers in Liyue. —Silk Flowers— For the well-to-do citizens of Liyue, the Silk Flower has a ubiquitous presence in their lives: It has a beautiful color and its soft petals can be processed to make silk. It also has a most delightful scent that can survive multiple rounds of processing, and even the weaving process itself. For this reason, Liyue's botanists have cultivated a special strain for exclusive use in perfume making — with the most luxurious perfumes being offered first and foremost, of course, to Rex Lapis for his approval. For the women of Liyue, highly prized Silk Flower perfumes are seen as holding different symbolic meanings based on the fragrance profile and composition. The unwritten rule in Liyue is that it is impolite to broach the topic of perfume with a woman in normal social interaction, but also that if an admirer is able to correctly guess the type of perfume one is wearing, as well as correctly deduce its unique properties and characteristics, all whilst conveying this in an articulate and tactful manner, the admirer is more likely to stand a chance of winning one's affection. A popular belief in the rural regions of Liyue is that the method for decocting Silk Flower perfume was originally taught to mortals by an adeptus living as a hermit on Mt. Aocang . In the age where divine beings coexisted alongside lowly mortals, the adeptus guided humans to learn the ways of courting and romancing from the birds, beasts, and plants. To a young woman bathing in a spring, it once took the form of a graceful illuminated bird, teaching her the exotic techniques of decocting and applying fragrant oils. Who was this young woman capable of stirring the heart of an adeptus living in deliberate seclusion from the world? With countless legends offering different versions of the story, the truth is impossible to know. But the art of decocting perfume from Silk Flowers was indeed passed on, for it survives to this very day. It is claimed that the subtle undertones of the perfume's scent and the gentle-but-nimble hand techniques used in the decoction process have remained unchanged throughout history on account of having proved themselves supremely fit for purpose time and time again. As they grow, Silk Flowers will exhibit different properties based on how their environmental conditions differ from their ancestral habitat. Liyue's merchants have coined plenty of tasteless terms for Silk Flowers of all types and uses. They tend to attribute them to Rex Lapis, claiming they once had the fortune to encounter him during one of his excursions in the mortal realm or pass them off as a merciful gift from an adeptus, such details always featuring as part of a wondrous, fantastical narrative. Sales tactics like these always manage to garner the interest of a shopper or two on their way through Liyue Harbor. High demand has pushed Liyue's merchants towards the mass cultivation of Silk Flowers and the ongoing breeding of new strains. This means that the striking sight of beautiful Silk Flowers is a common one in all highly populated areas, including the city and the towns. Sadly, geographical changes over Liyue's long history and ever-expanding mining activity have conspired to destroy the natural habitat of wild Silk Flowers, meaning that the flower is all but extinct in rural areas. The handful that can still be found in the wild are carefully looked after by adepti living in seclusion there. These Silk Flowers feature daintier, more elegant blossoms, which puts them in stark contrast to those cultivated by horticulturalists in urban centers. Interestingly, the people of Liyue see the pretty and sweet-smelling Silk Flower as one of the many symbols of Rex Lapis. Which begs the question: Has this mighty and imposing god, who typically takes a decidedly masculine form on his excursions to the mortal realm, ever taken the form of a woman and accepted a ritual offering in the form of a bunch of flowers? The sparse historical records on the one hand and the plethora of rumors of obscure origin on the other means that, while this claim is more or less impossible to verify, it also cannot be simply dismissed as baseless speculation. On a personal note — the writer has, on one occasion, personally witnessed a Statue of The Seven accept a carefully prepared and distinctly feminine gift that was presented to it in worship. As for the Geo Archon's innermost feelings upon receiving offerings from their subjects, however, this is not something that I, as an outsider in Liyue, consider myself qualified to comment on.A compilation of stories and legends of various knights-errant in Liyue. Some of them have been told for a long time but are still popular among the people. —The Hermit— The stone forest of Jueyun Karst is a mysterious place engulfed in mist all year around. Myths and legends abound among the herb gatherers, telling of adepti and evil spirits. Once, there was a herb seller named Qiangu who went to Jueyun Karst to investigate the distribution of medical herbs there. Unbeknownst to him, a group of brigands had followed him into the mountains. They waited for cover of night, and when he let his guard down they struck. He was knocked unconscious. The brigands grabbed his possessions, bound him from head to foot, and left him alone in the valley. Deep in the night, the herb seller finally awoke. He struggled against the ropes that bound him, and cried out for help. But the vast mountains did not respond. The only sounds to be heard in the thick mountain forest, save for the echoes of his own pitiful wails, were the faint cries of the birds disturbed by them. Qiangu sank into despair and sighed with sorrow. Just when he thought all hope was lost, a deep voice came rumbling through the mountains, cutting through the cries of nocturnal birds and the whistling of the wind. "Arise!" "I am unable to!" The herb seller protested amidst floods of tears. His cry frightened off a fox that was prowling in the night. But as he tensed his body once more against the ropes that bound him, he discovered they had completely loosened. The herb seller stood up. No sooner had he arisen that the disembodied voice, without pausing to hear the expression of gratitude that would be customary in such situations, spoke to him once more: "Ascend!" As instructed, Qiangu ascended the mountain, following the winding dirt track to the summit as the horizon began to glow in the east. From the summit he saw a twisted and withered pine growing on a cliff, its branches sprawling outwards as if trying to escape into the air. The gentle creaking of the branches drew his attention to the ropes that hung from them — at the other end of which hung the brigands from the night before, bound in like fashion from head to foot. Then he saw the old man whose voice he had heard, his hair and beard as white as snow sat atop a curiously shaped rock as if it were his throne. The old man took one look at Qiangu's disheveled appearance and grinned mischievously before returning his possessions to him intact. Qiangu inquired as to the old man's origins, but he replied that he belonged to the mountains, his home being wherever he roamed and his bed being wherever he laid his head. Qiangu sought to thank the old man with all manner of courtesies and compensations, but he dismissed them all. After much deliberation, he took just a single Mora to one day give as a wedding gift to Qiangu's beloved daughter, in order that he might attend the wedding feast. Out of disaster seemed to spring forth good fortune, for following this incident Qiangu's store grew ever more popular while word of the wealthy herb seller himself spread far and wide. Some say that after making his fortune, he returned to Jueyun Karst in search of the old man, but found nothing save for a few abandoned tents and empty wine bottles. Some claim to have spotted the old man at Yaoguang Shoal , disguised as a miner and darting around like the wind between the precipices. Others insist he is a fisherman who spends his time saving those who become stranded at sea. The stories are too many to count, and yet no one knows the old man's name. Lamentably, age and ill health have now ushered in the twilight years of Qiangu's life while his beloved daughter remains unmarried. Perhaps the day will come that the old man from the mountain attends the wedding feast, but that day seems impossibly far in the future for Qiangu. Vol. 2 A compilation of stories and legends of various knights-errant in Liyue. Some of them have been told for a long time but are still popular among the people. —Dust— The area known as the Guili Plains was once an area lush with Glaze Lilies . But it was beset by troubles on every side, forcing its residents of old to flee, while the prosperity of Liyue Harbor would attract many of those who took their place. But even so, many tales of gallantry continue to circulate in these wilds. In the tales of traveling merchants and porters, there was once a mysterious figure that would surface in the dead of night upon the plains: it was a maiden in a long indigo robe, striding along the shallows of the Bishui River , the moon wrapping her face with silver light as the night wind carried her words up to the shimmering, sleepless stars. According to guests at Wangshu Inn , only those who get lost amid the firefly-lights on summer nights might see her, and only those who can discern the scent of Glaze Lilies amid the dancing lights and Seelie floating in the dark could find her tracks. Some guessed that she might be a lost illuminated beast , or a sole servant of some long-dead god , gently mourning her master only at night. And some also believed her to simply be a gallant hero, like those who spurn civilization, hiding their real names. No one knows how her story began, but it ended with the tale of a certain hunter. But unlike the stories of those merchants, the hunter encountered her brandishing a sword against several perilous shadows under the merciless moonlight. After an elegant and sharp dance, the maiden was nowhere to be seen, with naught left but a pile of bloodied dust. The next day, some inquisitive citizens would discover the corpses of Millelith and land surveyors by the river. After this, no matter how many search parties the Ministry of Civil Affairs would send, no one saw that riverside maiden ever again. Perhaps that deadly dance was the fruit of some vendetta, or perhaps that woman had herself been some great brigand. Or perhaps that matter does not require any rhyme or reason at all. Heroes are heroes, after all, drawing their blades for reasons beyond common comprehension. But as the lights of Liyue Harbor consumed the deserted countryside villages day by day, this legend too would slowly disappear.

collection of Mondstadt ballads, recorded, compiled, and arranged by scholars centuries ago. —Ballad Selection Excerpt— "Breeze Amidst the Forest" and "Breeze Upon the Lake" constitute a two-volume collection of narrative poems. The compilation is the result of the tireless work of scholars who have recorded and arranged countless songs sung by Mondstadt bards. Bards often elaborate or fabricate history to draw in an audience and earn a few extra Mora. Hence, most of their works have extremely low credibility. What has allowed the songs to remain popular to this day, and to stand the test of the thousand winds of time, is the threads of spectacular imagination and ingenious rhetoric that have been woven into them. ... "What to be sung hails from ancient times." "The gods walked among us in their prime." The poet, who had finished recounting the tales of the ruins and Vennessa , began to tell the story of the Wind Dragon . He began to sing, "The story to be told hails from ancient times, when the gods walked among us in their prime." The dragon graced by Anemo was born* in the high heavens in that age of wonders. He slowly descended, and inspected everything with curious eyes. He landed in a village, only for the terrified villagers to throw rocks at him. The dragon could not understand why they cried in fear. He landed in a cemetery, only to hear the lament of grieving people. The dragon could not understand what they murmured in sorrow. He landed in an orchard, only to be cursed by the furious farmers who lost their trees. The dragon could not understand why they screamed in anger. The world was too complicated for a young dragon. The dragon was bewildered, yet he did not give up. One day, the dragon heard music pouring out from the Holy Lyre der Himmel. This was the name of the lyre belonging to the Anemo Archon . Enchanted by the poetry, the Wind Dragon landed beside the best singer under the skies. People panicked, for the mighty elemental dragons and the great archons that reigned over the earth had never seen eye to eye. "Behold his beauty and benignity!" The Windborne Bard sang. "But we do not know him," the people replied. What mysterious magic lies behind music and poetry that has the power to mesmerize both dragons and humans alike? I, for one, cannot fathom it. The dragon decided to stay with the bard, for he too wished to be understood by all souls. He learned human speech and Windborne Bard's singing techniques. ...omitted... Later generations regarded him as one of the Four Winds that watched over and protected Mondstadt. "An atrous sun befell its kingdom and a luminous pearl lost its glow." &#91; Note 1 &#93; "Niveous silk grew dim and wheaten gold burned brilliantly no more." So begins another tale that occurred in the lost Khaenri'ah Kingdom. The Eclipse Dynasty had fallen, and disaster spread across the land. The alchemist known as Gold was corrupted by their own greed and ambition, and created an army of shadowy monsters with their uncanny powers. &#91; Note 2 &#93; Durin , a black serpentine dragon, rose from the sea to cast its shadow over Mondstadt. But it was at this very moment that there was no one to inherit the title of Lionfang Knight, thus, the Knights of Favonius could not fly their falcon flag. The persistent yet despondent prayers called upon the archon of Mondstadt, the Windborne Bard. The strings of the lyre were strummed once more, and the Wind Dragon was summoned forth. As Mondstadt's last line of defense, the Wind Dragon battled the wicked dragon to the death in raging storms. The Wind Dragon prevailed. He tore open the throat of the wicked dragon, at the cost of ingesting its poisonous blood. The blood of the wicked dragon was distorted gold, with the powers to crumble mountains and poison the earth. The Wind Dragon protected Mondstadt with his life, and his only wish was to be understood by humans. And so, he drifted off into a deep slumber. The Holy Lyre played a sorrowful tune. The Holy Lyre sang: should you awaken, spread your wings and live your life freely! A dragon is born to soar the skies, and mortals shall surely grasp your beauty... (*Typically, when life arises from the elements, it either descends and becomes a slime , or ascends and becomes a crystalfly . Rarely does this process give rise to dangerous elemental monsters. Elemental dragons are rarely seen and have the powers to match the gods of old.) Vol. 2 A supplement to the "Breeze Amidst the Forest" ballad selection with excerpts from various sources. It tells the story of the Dragon of Mondstadt. —The Dragon— An excerpt from "An Investigation into the Cultural Customs of the Wind Kingdom," more commonly known as "Records of Customs and Culture," by Jacob Musk . &#91; Note 3 &#93; ... The "Wolf" of the Knight of Boreas, the "Lion" of the Lionfang Knight (or "Dandelion Knight"), the "Falcon" of the Knights of Favonius, and the "Wind Dragon" Dvalin have been long regarded as the Four Winds that watch over Mondstadt. After the Lionfang Knight liberated Mondstadt, the Knights of Favonius was established, and the Knight of Boreas joined them. The tradition of worshipping the Four Winds was gradually formed in Mondstadt. However, Dvalin, the ancient Wind Dragon, predated them all. Approximately one hundred years ago, &#91; Note 4 &#93; the land was in chaos. Darkness spread, contaminating everything it touched. Barbarians and foul creatures roamed the lands, forcing people to dwell within the city walls. It was an especially difficult time for Mondstadt. &#91; Note 5 &#93; The Lionfang Knight was without a suitable heir, and the Knights of Favonius had lost many of its brave men and women during the bitter wars. During the most difficult of times, Durin, the corrupted dragon of immeasurable power, began attacking Mondstadt. The prayers of Mondstadt's people awoke the Anemo Archon, and his will summoned forth the Wind Dragon Dvalin. As the last defender of Mondstadt, Dvalin battled Durin with all his might. The result was clear — Durin's remains still lie atop the snowy peaks to the south of Mondstadt — but the story of how the battle ended was lost in time. It is said that Dvalin ripped out Durin's throat, and together they fell from the sky. Durin's body sunk into the snow while Dvalin was summoned by the Anemo Archon and fell into a slumber. ... People used to believe that Dvalin would awaken whenever Mondstadt faces a new threat. But in these times of peace, the belief of the Four Winds has gradually eroded and their temples lie all but completely deserted. (Citation of unknown origin: By the time the Knights finally discovered that the foreign monstrosity named Stormterror, with which they clashed countless times, was in fact Dvalin of the Four Winds, the enmity that had grown between them and driven them to conflict could not be undone. One can scarcely imagine the betrayal Dvalin must have felt when he awoke after a hundred years of slumber only to find that the people of Mondstadt, whom he had protected with his life, had forsaken him...)Zixin is a poor fisherwoman whose family struggles to make ends meet.

It would seem I am fated for a life on the ocean." (Dongtang, lento, innig) Zixin: "With sail rope in hand, I cast a net among the free-swimming fish. It is with their trade that I shall sustain my family." (Zixin casts out the net and brings it back in) (Dongtang, appassionato) Zixin: "It is hard every day under the sun, moon, and stars. The rich live fitfully whilst the poor must struggle. This is the way of things." Zixin: "I too am envious of the wealthy women's splendor, though I have never pitied myself, even with but a single string of pearls on my wrist." Zixin: "I have nothing to show for myself but bare walls. All I have is what I make with my own hands." (Zixin ties her boat to the wharf and jumps to the shore) (Dongtang, senza misura) Zixin: "It's time to go on the streets and sell fish." (Exit Zixin) Scene II (Enter Zixin carrying a hand-basket) (Dongtang, straziante) Zixin: "Fresh fish, fresh fish! Buy it here, buy it now!" (Enter Grandma Zhang carrying a flower basket) (Sprechstimme) Grandma Zhang: "Look at those fish (fish wag their tails, spraying Grandma Zhang with water), so fierce! They will make a tasty soup!" Grandma Zhang: "All soaked like that, from head to hips, don't I look like a young lady with pink cheeks and vermilion lips?" (Aside) Zixin: "What do they call you, granny?" Grandma Zhang: "You can call me Grandma Zhang. I sell flowers on this street." Grandma Zhang: "Deary, such a soft-spoken girl like you won't sell a fish before the sky turns dark." Grandma Zhang: "You might be beautiful, but if you're too shy to raise your voice, you won't be able to fill your stomach." (Zixin lowers her head) (Aside) Zixin: "You're so funny, granny." Zixin: "Oh no... Where..." Grandma Zhang: "What happened?" Zixin: "My string of pearls, I never take it off my wrist. But it's gone. How could that be?" (Enter Fan Jie, dressed in colorful stage clothing and holding the string of pearls) (Dongtang, andante calmo) Fan Jie: "Like a golden crow that utters the truth beyond the waves blue, I went for a stroll and a string of pearls appeared in my view." (Aside) Fan Jie: "My name's Fan Jie, at your service. I make a living doing odd jobs in the docks. My brothers here selected me as their leader." Fan Jie: "The string of pearls I picked up today must belong to that lady." Fan Jie: "I intend to return it to its rightful owner, though I don't want to be falsely accused of any indecent act." Fan Jie: "Perhaps I shall see if there are any marks of wearing the pearls on her wrist." (Dongtang, 12-bar prelude, irato) Fan Jie: "In scorching sun and steaming breeze, does selling fish come with ease?" Zixin: "My fish are fresh, that I guarantee. Boil them or fry, the choice belongs to thee." Fan Jie: "Those fish are as fierce as a tiger, they won't stop moving even for a second." Fan Jie: "Would you step forward and introduce yourself?" (Zixin steps forward) Fan Jie: "It's only fitting that these beautiful pearls belong to a fair lady of equal beauty." (Dongtang, appassionato) Zixin: "My heart is telling me that this man might be a mack, taking pleasure in playing with me, but he won't fool me with his nonsense." Zixin: "I turn around with my apricot eyes wide open and scold him." Zixin: "Such a scoundrel like you must have no dignity!" (Aside) Fan Jie: "No need to get so angry, milady. I just wanted to check if there are marks of wearing the pearls on your wrist." Fan Jie: "It looks like, indeed, you are the rightful owner, milady. Now that the string of pearls is returned to you, you need not worry anymore." Fan Jie: "My name's Fan..." (Fan Jie pauses, covers his mouth, and turns to leave. Exit Fan Jie.) Fan Jie: "It's time for me to go, ha." (Aside) Zixin: "Oh hero, please wait..." (Dongtang, lento, innig) Zixin: "Led by my timid heart, I wronged a righteous man." Zixin: "I can't even remember the name of that hero of mine. What should I do to thank him?" (Aside) Zixin: "How shameful..." Grandma Zhang: "But my deary, what is it if not destiny? A fair lady has finally met her noble hero." Vol. 2 The young man who had returned Zixin's string of pearls left without revealing his name. Grandma Zhang comes up with a plan that will allow Zixin to find him... —Act II: The Search for the Gentleman— Male Role: Fan Jie Female Role: Zixin Comic Role: Grandma Zhang Comic Roles: Zhang San, Li Si, Wang Er'ma Scene I (Enter Zixin and Grandma Zhang) (Aside) Zixin: "I have been depressed of late, and in no wise have I been at peace." Zixin: "For I spoke in error 'gainst a hero seeking to do good." Zixin: "He sought to return my string of pearls, and I did him no thanks nor ask him his name, but instead upbraided him most grievously." Zixin: "Shamed I am, and do wish to find my benefactor, but amidst this vast harbor, how shall I find him?" Grandma Zhang: "As I see it, deary, you need not be sorrowful, nor should you be troubled." Zixin: "Oh, granny, why do you say so?" Grandma Zhang: "You need only put up a notice, offering Mora up to the one who returns the string of pearls. Will he not then come forth?" (Ganging, andante calmo) Zixin: "Thus is it said—" Zixin: "As wine turns red peoples' faces, so do riches move many places." (Zixin lowers her head and paces) Zixin: "I am of a mind to find him with this device, yet I wonder if he should come forthwith." (Aside) Grandma Zhang: "Come now, do not hesitate. Let us take action." Grandma Zhang: "You shall lose little who rely on me." (Exeunt Zixin and Grandma Zhang) Scene II (Enter Zhang San, Li Si, Wang Er'ma) (Sprechstimme) Zhang San: "I am Zhang San." Li Si: "I, Li Si." Wang Er'ma: "And Wang Er'ma I." Zhang San: "Hark at that notice! Let me go up, and earn the bounty." Li Si: "Shall the officer ask, 'think to do good, do you?'" Wang Er'ma: "Hah! A fool is he who would speak true." (Aside) Zhang San: "Ho, brothers. Are you all bound for that lass Zixin's place, her reward to claim?" Li Si: "Indeed." Wang Er'ma: "So it is." Li Si: "Picked up her headdress also, did you?" Wang Er'ma: "No, I'd have sworn it was her earrings." Li Si: "Falsehood - t'was the flower upon her head." Zhang San: "Fools. Perfume it was!" Wang Er'ma: "Ah, however it may be, sure am I that we all know well the score." Zhang San: "Ahahah." Li Si: "Haha!" (Zhang San, Li Si, and Wang Er'ma turn to Zixin) Zhang San: "Ah, Zixin, have you my bounty ready? For I, Zhang San, have found your lost perfume!" Li Si: "Stand aside, friend, for I have come to return your headdress. The prize is mine, therefore." Wang Er'ma: "No, no, no, Wang Er'ma it is who returns your earrings. Mine is the reward." Zixin: "You... you lot dizzy me." Zixin: "For we have never met, and if I lost my earrings, scents, or headwear, would I not know it?" Zhang San: "Why, you must have forgotten it in your hurry at the fish-store. Just give the reward here, do not worry!" Li Si: "The Mora, then, and be quick about it!" Wang Er'ma: "Or I shall ruin your stall, and your good name." Zixin: "Ah... How I have attracted the eye of these worthless scoundrels!" Zixin: "Granny, see what trouble your plan has wrought!" Grandma Zhang: "Worry not, lass. I shall devise a way to see them off." Grandma Zhang: "Hah!" (Zhang San, Li Si, Wang Er'ma fall to the ground) Grandma Zhang: "I had this lass put up a false bounty to catch such thieves as you!" Grandma Zhang: "The items you bring are false — now hand them over." Grandma Zhang: "Or else..." Zhang San: "Or else what?" Grandma Zhang: "Then the headdress made of prize Glaze Lilies , the earrings of fine Noctilucous Jade , and the scents shipped in from a faraway land... Grandma Zhang: "You shall have to pay for them all! Now then, where is the Mora? Give it here!" (Grandma Mang pursues Zhang San, Li Si, Wang Er'ma, broom in hand) Zhang San: "Ow, ow!" Li Si: "Stop hitting us, please! We don't want your Mora anymore!" Wang Er'ma: "Now to find that fellow who truly picked her things up to come and own up — sooner rather than late!" Scene III (Zhang San brings Fan Jie in) (Aside) Zhang San: "Why, I have it now. You must be the thief who took the lady's things. My brothers and I took a beating on your account!" Fan Jie: "I, Fan Jie, have ever been upright, and such things as stealing are beneath me. Do not think to accuse me falsely." Zhang San: "Well, aren't you a stubborn one? Dare you go up with me to meet the owner of the lost goods?" Fan Jie: "I fear you not. Let us go! Indeed, I should like to see who it is who maligns me." (Zhang San and Fan Jie turn to Zixin) Zhang San: "Is the proprietor not Zixin? I shall see how you get out of this one!" Fan Jie: "Ah! So it is you, then!" (Dongtang, appassionato) Fan Jie: "This was the lady who was wroth, and no more words came from her mouth." (Dongtang, allegro) Fan Jie: "Cease deceiving the young woman, for I am Fan Jie, a dock worker." Fan Jie: "I have lived frugally and humbly. Whereupon would I steal a lady's makeup?" Fan Jie: "You met my honesty with accusations, though I returned the item swiftly as I could." (Aside) Zixin: "Ah, so this hero is named Fan Jie." Zixin: "It is my fault, then, that he should have been tangled up in this business." Zixin: "I shall beg his forgiveness shortly — and should he not accept, twice or thrice more shall not be too few." (Zixin walks up to apologize to Fan Jie) Zixin: "O, hero, indeed we had a misunderstanding before, but..." (Fan Jie turns) Fan Jie: "Hmph." (Zixin smiles and steps forward) Zixin: "...I did have some other motive in doing this." Zixin: "For you did not leave your name behind when you left, and I wished to repay you but found you not." Zixin: "So I decided on this device. It is my fault that such trouble came to you." Zixin: "Please, allow me to apologize." Fan Jie: "Oh?" (Dongtang, lento, innig) Fan Jie: "Though I was at first resentful to be maligned, when I calm down to think, I realize it was but a misunderstanding." Fan Jie: "Calm must rule me, lest I speak in error." (Aside) Fan Jie: "If I may ask you..." Fan Jie: "You said earlier that the business from before was a misunderstanding." Fan Jie: "You were of a mind to seek the person who returned your string of pearls, and put out that notice, which by chance snared me wrongly, is that true?" Zixin: "It is, and again, I apologize." (Fan Jie catches Zixin) Fan Jie: "Nay, you need not be so polite. You do me too much honor." Fan Jie: "I, too, acted rashly, and put you upon the spot. I, too, must apologize." Zixin: "Oh, no, please..." (Fan Jie salutes her) Zhang San: "What!? What are you doing? So is the Mora to be paid or not?" Grandma Zhang: "Oh, shush you. This is their tale — what business is it of yours?" Grandma Zhang: "See, all the ladies and gentlemen in the audience are here to see a show by Yun Jin . and they have no time for your nonsense." Grandma Zhang: "Open your eyes and see, and stand aside there." (Exeunt, Grandma Zhang dragging Zhang San) Zixin: "Come to think of it, I sell fish here every day. How is it, then, that I have never seen you?" Fan Jie: "I pass this way each day to work." Fan Jie: "Perhaps I was lost amid the throng. But perchance we may meet tomorrow..." Zixin: "So it is... May we meet then." Vol. 3 Our heroine meets the young man again. They fall in love and are ready to live together happily ever after. But a despot who covets Zixin's beauty and virtue is putting the skids under their plans... —Act III: The Pearls, Lost Again— Male Role: Fan Jie Female Role: Zixin Comic Role: Grandma Zhang Villain: Wu Wang Comic Roles: Wu Yi, Wu Er Scene I (Enter Zixin and Fanjie from either side) (Aloud) Fan Jie: "The dogs do bark excitedly at dawn." Zixin: "The sun shines, and the frost on the eaves thin." (Aside) Fan Jie: "Is that Ms. Zixin I see?" Zixin: "Indeed, it is! Is that you, Fan Jie?" (Dongtang, senza misura) Fan Jie: "I dreamt of you fair last night." Zixin: "I regretted our parting, though we meet again soon." Both: "That my heart's desire should come true." (Aside, unison) Zixin: "O Hero..." Fan Jie: "O Maiden..." (Aside) Fan Jie: The sun speeds westwards and high, and work begins at the docks. I must go and begin my day." Fan Jie: "Ms. Zixin, I take my leave." (Zixin salutes and watches him depart. Fan Jie turns back as he grows further away. Zixin lowers and raises her head again as Fan Jie exits. Zixin wrings her hands.) (Dongtang, lento, innig) Zixin: "Ah, to have turned cowardly at the last moment!" (Exit Zixin) Scene II (Enter the playboy Wu Wang, open-collared and dressed in green, with his companions Wu Yi and Wu Er) (Aloud) Wu Wang: "I am the great Wu Wang, master of these streets." Wu Wang: "Today I am bored and idle, and thus stroll about looking for sport." (Aside) Wu Wang: "Wu Yi, Wu Er!" (Same Aside) Both: "Yes, sir?" (Aside) Wu Wang: "I have a mind to eat something new today. Have you any ideas?" Wu Yi: "What about some Golden Shrimp Balls ?" Wu Wang: "I tire of fine meat and fatty fish. Golden Shrimp Balls seem alright." Wu Wang: "Wu Er, go hence and find a store that sells a serving of those shrimp balls." Wu Er: "I will." Wu Wang: "Wait. It must be fried to a pure golden sheen, without even the slightest hint of being burnt." Wu Er: "Without even the slightest hint of being burnt. Okay." Wu Wang: "Hold. And they must be of size most equal. Not one shall be larger or smaller than the next." Wu Er: "And they shall all be the same size, yes. Do you wish to go over the instructions again?" Wu Wang: "No need." Wu Er: "Do you have any other requests, sir? Just say the word." Wu Er: "And if the store fails to meet your expectations, then let's do as we always do—" Wu Yi: "What do we always do?" Wu Er: "Not give them any Mora, of course." Wu Wang: "No, no, come, look at the fish store yonder. Now there's a beauty more filling than a fine meal." (Dongtang, lento, innig) Wu Wang: "Let us go up and seek some details as we may... All the better to seize her with." (Wu Wang turns to Zixin) (Aside) Zixin: "Would you like to buy fish, sir?" Wu Wang: "Why, of course, of course. Which family do you hail from, miss, and where fare your parents?" Zixin: "I grew up at the docks. My parents have grown old, and I run the store alone, selling fish to make ends meet." Zixin: "Why do you ask, sir?" (Turns, sotto voce) Wu Wang: "Wonderful, wonderful. Her parents are not at hand. A fine chance to strike, indeed." (Turns back, facing Zixin) Wu Wang: "Then, miss, are you yet engaged, or pledged to be wedded?" Zixin: "I have not, sir, for I have busied myself working all this time." Zixin: "But sir, what has the matter of my marriage have to do with your business buying fish?" (Turns, sotto voce) Wu Wang: "Very good, very good! She has plighted no troth. If trouble should come of this, no one will save her." (Turns back, facing Zixin) Wu Wang: "Then, miss, have you one you are enamored with?" (Zixin lowers her head and says nothing) (Dongtang, senza misura) Wu Wang: "See, see how she casts down her eyes without speaking. So, then, there is no such person. Evil enters and masters my thoughts—" Wu Wang: "Come, friends, take her hence — let us not waste precious time or beauty." (Exeunt Wu Wang, Wu Yi, and Wu Er, taking Zixin with them) Scene III (Enter Grandma Zhang) (Aside) Grandma Zhang: "Now then, ladies and gentlemen, if you have listened oft to Yun Jin's plays and become wise to the ways of theater, then you have likely guessed what shall come next." Grandma Zhang: "Shall we not now accelerate towards a fight most fierce?" Grandma Zhang: "But afore the hero steps forth, he must by fortune be inspired." Grandma Zhang: "When evil beasts run amok, disturbing the lives of the people, or when times and tides are turbulent, that is when heroes arise." Grandma Zhang: "If you should pluck up your courage, your deeds shall be remembered. But if you prove craven..." Grandma Zhang: "Who then will remember if you were named Zhang Jie, Wang Jie, or Fan Jie?" Grandma Zhang: "And what's more, we ordinary folk must show our mettle, and yet leave a tale of rescuing our fair lady." Grandma Zhang: "Let us see how Fan Jie shall act." (Enter Fan Jie) (Aside) Grandma Zhang: "Alas, why have you only arrived now?" Grandma Zhang: "Miss Zixin here was just taken by the notorious hooligan, Wu Wang!" (Dongtang, allegro) Fan Jie: "Ah, alas!" Fan Jie: "When I heard her words I was a-fright, but I never thought that catastrophe was so near to me." Fan Jie: "This villain burns, steals, and kills as he wills. If I were to go forth..." Fan Jie: "I shall, in all likelihood, not return." (Grandma Zhang tosses the string of pearls to Fan Jie) Grandma Zhang: "S—sir Fan, wh—whatever shall we do?" (Dongtang, allegro) Fan Jie: "As I see these pearls, my resolve hardens—" Fan Jie: "How could I surrender a maiden to this villain?" Fan Jie: "Pearl-string in hand, I draw my sword in fury — to make contrite that Wu Wang, and have him sue for mercy." (Exeunt Fan Jie and Grandma Zhang) Vol. 4 To rescue the one he loves, the young man charges heedlessly into danger, entering the lair of the enemy with his sword drawn: and on the other side, his beloved hangs on desperately... —Act IV: Trial By Candlelight— Male Role: Fan Jie Female Role: Zixin Comic Villain: Wu Wang Scene I (Fan Jie with a robe, stage upper left, Zixin sits alone, stage right) (Dongtang, appassionato) Fan Jie: "O cursed villain, to steal a maiden in broad daylight! My beloved suffers and I grieve." Fan Jie: "So it falls to my sword to bring judgment on those who so forsake the law." Fan Jie: "Let us away." (Fan Jie spurs his horse and heads for Wu Wang's stronghold) (Aside) Fan Jie: "Swiftly did I ride here, pursuing the sounds of merriment from afar." Fan Jie: "This, then, must be the wolf's den." Fan Jie: "If I am to rescue Zixin, I must scout their lair out with care." Fan Jie: "A good plan. We go!" (Fan Jie leaps over the rear wall, exeunt.) (Common time) Zixin: "Within a lone lamp and half-burnt candles — and without lurk the wolves and tigers." Zixin: "Who could have expected such disaster? And how shall I flee this hive of villainy?" Scene II (Wu Wang enters from right through a door, drunk) (Aloud) Wu Wang: "I come and go wherever I am pleased, and even gods fall if I am not appeased." (Aside) Wu Wang: "Haha, got one in the day, didn't I? Hehe." Wu Wang: "That lovely, lovely lady." Wu Wang: "Now that we have made merry, as is our wont. It is time — we meet the fair maiden!" (Dongtang, andante calmo) Zixin: "Here that impetuous drunken rascal comes. Still! The weeping candlelight is in my hand." (Aside) Zixin: "You shall not have me!" (Wu Wang chases Zixin. Zixin strikes Wu Wang with the candlestick. He falls down. She slumps in relief.) (Dongtang, andante calmo) Zixin: "In the confusion, a stroke of fortune! On shaking feet I flee." (Aside) Zixin: "Not a light to be seen outside. How is this so dark?" Zixin: "Perhaps I should relight this candle—" Zixin: "No. Would I not be imperiled if recaptured?" Zixin: "Better then to carry this unlit light, and grope our way out through the night." Zixin: "Yes, so shall it be done." Vol. 5 The bandit lair in the dead of night is pitch-dark. The tyrant, the youth, and the lady grope in the dark in search of one another, and there, a perilous misunderstanding is about to play out... —Act V: Twin Pearls Returned— Male Role: Fan Jie Female Role: Zixin Comic Villain: Wu Wang Scene I (Fan Jie at stage upper left, Zixin at stage upper right. Wu Wang lies on the ground, his eyes closed) (The two people grope in the darkness of Wu Wang's lair) (Their hands make contact in the dark, but not knowing who the other is, they draw away in alarm) (Wu Wang awakens) (Aside) Wu Wang: "Why, that girl is as willful as I, to dare to strike me so." Wu Wang: "No one is about. Perhaps they have fled further within." Wu Wang: "Hmph. The night is come, the gate is closed." Wu Wang: "Unless they jumped the wall, how should that maiden escape? Surely not by the gate!" (Wu Wang enters the hall) (Aside) Wu Wang: "Hah. These louts are drunk out of their gourds. Not one light they lit!" Wu Wang: "Well, let me get myself one, and let us begin our search." (Wu Wang steps on Fan Jie's foot in the dark, and they both draw back) Wu Wang: "Haha, so there you are!" (Wu Wang stretches his arms out to lunge at Fan Jie, who ducks. They stumble about in the dark as Zixin shrinks into a corner) (Wu Wang finally grabs Fan Jie) Wu Wang: "I have you!" (Aside) Wu Wang: "Hmm? Have you grown so wide about the waist since last we met?" Fan Jie: "I put on more clothes, all the better to keep warm with." Wu Wang: "Indeed, one must wear more in cold weather." Wu Wang: "Then why have you grown so tall?" Fan Jie: "I have worn high shoes, all the better to put on a show with." Wu Wang: "Oh, surely that must be difficult." Wu Wang: "And why have your hands grown so rough?" Fan Jie: "Well... Lean closer and I shall tell you." Wu Wang: "Of course, of course." (Fan Jie stabs Wu Wang with his sword) Fan Jie: "To bear a sword, All the better to take your life with." (Wu Wang falls) Scene II (Aside) Fan Jie: "Foul villain. But a stroke, and you are slain." Zixin: "Are you Fan Jie?" Fan Jie: "This voice — you must be Miss Zixin!" (Fan Jie and Zixin reach out and touch each other) Zixin: "Fan Jie!" Fan Jie: "You must have suffered." Fan Jie: "I have slain that devil. His minions are all that remains." Fan Jie: "His death shall scatter them like monkeys when their great tree falls." Fan Jie: "Do not fear, I shall break the gate." (Fan Jie breaks the gate) Zixin: "Ah! My life would have been forfeit had you not arrived." (Dongtang, lento, innig) Zixin: "A heart of pearls in your house shall nest." Fan Jie: "In the skies with the wind shall we find rest." Fan Jie: The white moon shines o'er the catalpas glade. Zixin: And with lowered head, the promise is made. —End— Location Vol. 1 Vol. 1 Location Additional context Vol. 4 Vol. 4 Location Additional context Vol. 5 Vol. 5 Location Additional context Other Languages Language Official Name Literal Meaning English String of Pearls — Chinese (Simplified) xe8xbfx9exe5xbfx83xe7x8fxa0 Lixc3xa1n xxc4xabn zhxc5xab Pearls Connecting Hearts Chinese (Traditional) xe9x80xa3xe5xbfx83xe7x8fxa0 Lixc3xa1n xxc4xabn zhxc5xab Japanese xe9x80xa3xe5xbfx83xe7x8fxa0 Renshinshu&#8205;&#8203; !

first part of a traditional Inazuman novel. This particular volume is also known as "Shinkageuchi," and was once a restricted text. It contains a fantastical tale about the first Raiden Shogun and her kagemusha , depicting the benevolent sagacity of the first Shogun and the great valor of her kagemusha. However, due to the great popularity of another book known colloquially as " Raiden Reincarnation ," many people became interested in stories of this kind. This book thus wound up being published in a haphazard manner. It is often said that the "drawn bow is like the quartered moon, and studying the blade is like a circle of transparent jade." It is said that when Narukami came to her people, she brought with her the knowledge of crafting swords. After thousands of years and hundreds of bountiful harvests, mortal swordsmiths were at last able to make swords that would please even Narukami herself. Thus did the Grand Shrine and the Shogunate enact this divine ceremony: they collected the greatest swords in the world and offered them up to the shrine, thus naming these blades "Goshintou." This ceremony was a very lively one indeed, and the practice persists to the present period. However, there are many behind-the-curtain matters concerning the "Goushintou" that few know of. No famous craftsman merely forges one blade in one sitting. The greatest of their works are known as "Shinuchi," and are given a lovely name before being offered to the craftsman's lord or deity. These are not built for taking lives and are to remain pure. The others are known as "Kageuchi" and will be given to retainers for them use as weapons. These will often be used to shed blood and will thus be stained with impurity and filth. From the day Narukami Gongen , the First Shogun, began her dominion over the land of Inazuma, she was accompanied by her younger twin sister. "Shin" and "Kage," light and dark they were, mediating and holding court, ordering and giving battle. The younger of the two was named " Ei ," and if her name were to be written plainly, it would likely be the word for "shadow," which she was in relation to the first Shogun, to whom she would become the successor. As most know, only The Seven emerged from the wrack and ruin of the war that rolled across the mortal world like a crimson storm. Though the Shadow Shogun was divinely skilled in martial arts and unsurpassed with the blade, she believed herself little more than a warrior with little understanding of mortal hearts. Thus, she chose to give up her bodily form, helping her sister to ascend to the "heavenly citadel" and obtain dominion over Inazuma. Shortly after, the True Shogun, "Makoto," set up her Shogunate and began to rule over the land. Remembering their bond, she recalled "Ei"'s divine will and reforged her body, thus returning her sister to her side once more as her kagemusha.The prefaces of the new light novel "The Saga of Hamavaran," now combined into their own separate volume due to a business model adjustment! Foreword Thanks to a fruitful new writer recruitment drive and the phenomenal success of the contest "This Novel is Amazing!" we have received many highly original works from up-and-coming writers all over the world. We would like to take this opportunity to thank our international writers for supporting Inazuma 's light novel industry, and we'd also like to thank Kanjou Commissioner Hiiragi Shinsuke for his grace and generosity. It is thanks to all of you that we are able to bring so many outstanding works to the readers of Inazuma here today. As you all know, prior to the promulgation of the Sakoku Decree , a number of accomplished samurai from various lands were active in Inazuma. One of them, whose name is Hamavaran, hails from the distant rainforest nation of Sumeru , but came all the way to the land of the lightning's glow to be an agent of chivalry. Though tales of Hamavaran's deeds were once buried during the peak of unchanging eternity under Her Excellency the Shogun , they have now been given life anew thanks to the narrative prowess of a good friend of mine, the budding author, Pursina . Now, without further ado, please enjoy "The Saga of Hamavaran" at your leisure. Vol. 2 "How could this happen..." An ordinary scholar from Sumeru is unexpectedly assigned an unpopular specialization and ordered to go forth to the land of thunder and lightning... The curtains slowly rise on an adventure in the nation of many shores! "It's not the tempest at sea I'm worried about, it's the prospect of deferred graduation..." This was the thought occupying Hamavaran's mind on his long voyage to Inazuma... "You're worrying about not getting your thesis finished in time and having to delay your graduation, aren't you?" The familiar-sounding voice came from outside the cabin. "Shush... Who are you, anyway!?" "Who, me? Is that important?" "Good point. No, you're not that important..." "Hey..." ... And so, as the great thunderstorm raged, shaking the seas and heavens alike, Hamavaran began arguing with the quiet voice from outside the window, while all worries about the storm and fears about not completing the thesis on time paled into insignificance. But strangely, when Hamavaran arrived on shore, the owner of the voice that had been arguing back from outside the window was nowhere to be seen. "Maybe it was the ghost of a shipwreck victim..." Hamavaran considered this possibility. Ghosts are just the Ley Lines ' memories of the deceased, Hamavaran reasoned. It's a completely natural phenomenon that occurs due to resonance between past and present. To be sure, it's highly unusual for this to happen in the middle of the ocean, but it's by no means impossible. "Who are you calling a ghost? You're the ghost!" Hamavaran had finally produced a satisfactory hypothesis to explain away the symptoms of delirium and had moved onto luggage-collection when the familiar voice piped up once more. Vol. 3 "'Ghost-calling'? Is that the same as 'spirit-warding' back home?" With confusing questions swirling in his mind, Hamavaran begins to speak with his newfound traveling companion. An unexpected journey begins! ... "So, you really are a ghost?" "No! I'm not even dead yet!" "But you've never been alive either?" "Um... Yeah, I guess you could say that..." The talkative young girl, who claimed to be a shikigami, gulped down glutinous-rice dango with such speed and intensity that Hamavaran began to worry she might choke. "If I had to explain it, I'd say my situation is more like that of a 'ghost-calling.'" "So like I said, a ghost..." "Noooo, not that kind of ghost!" One argument later, Hamavaran finally understood that what she called "ghost-calling" was something roughly equivalent to what in Sumeru is known as "spirit-warding." Both involve signing a pact using one's real name. The notion that you can command someone when you know their real name is common to many of the world's mystic traditions, and it highlights a core fear held by humans: the fear of being under someone else's control. With thoughts thusly wandering, Hamavaran once again began to regret specializing in the much-neglected discipline of marine biology instead of mysticism... First I have to sail all the way to Inazuma, then I have to go through the living hell that is a thesis defense... But maybe running into this noisy little thing is a stroke of good luck for me...A novel based on Watatsumi Island 's folktales. The original edition of this text was transcribed on Watatsumi Island and brought back to Narukami Island by a merchant while the former's serpent god yet lived. No one reads this ancient tome nowadays, its role supplanted by all the light novels on the market. This book describes the unique cosmological outlook of the Watatsumi people before they came to adopt aspects of Narukami culture, and a recent resurgence in traditional novel publishing has allowed it to see the light of day once more. —The Serpent and Drakes of Tokoyokoku — Mysteries creation conceals, the sun and moon omens reveal. Three corners in darkness shrouded, the void by five saints clouded. "The universe has no beginning and no end, and so it was with the land that once was. But this matters not to us, for the land that bears us no longer has anything to do with that eternity without start or ceasing." — So said the lone sage, Aberaku , to the first Sunchild . The Sunchild had long intended to punish Aberaku. Summoning the sage before the throne in this manner was but an additional way of making things difficult for him before detaining him. Legend has it that Aberaku was opened up to wisdom by Tokoyo Ookami , and was thus able to bring light to Enkanomiya, which had till then never seen the sun. But the Sunchild grew jealous of his talents, thus imprisoning him for life. Yet these children of the sun never considered that had Aberaku not created that underground star, they never would have existed in the first place. "The origin of heaven and earth is like the chicken and egg, and are not dragons and snakes kin?" No sooner had the sage Aberaku uttered these words than he was overthrown by troops lying in ambush. At that time, Enkanomiya had only just been bought some room to breathe by the appearance of the sun. The Dragonheirs loved the dark and shunned the light, and thus could no longer act with impunity. The days when the Dragonheirs would rampage and graze upon humanity like so much grass had, at last, come to an end, for the people of Enkanomiya finally had the means to resist. Yet it came to pass that the flaws in human nature would rear their ugly heads even before such outside threats could be quelled. The people chose a Sunchild, crowned him king, and worshiped him, and yet he ruled with a brutal hand, framing the righteous. Unnumbered years would pass before a young child of Enkanomiya would make a wager with his peers. Alone, he would dive beyond the three corners, evading the trail of the Dragonheirs, in search of a Dragonbone Flower . But what he found instead within a great cavern was a mighty serpent , one he had never seen before. Somehow, as he gazed upon the serpent's titanic form, the child felt no fear, but instead a kind of kinship. "I am the Profane Serpent. Though my servants are numberless, not one mortal now dwells in my shadow. That I have fallen into this realm, and that we should meet... Perhaps this is fate. You are not one of my people, but you are human nonetheless. Speak your desire, and I shall hear it." "Could you then, perchance, become our god ?" Thus did they, human and serpent, go forth to face the royal authority of the Sunchild and the incursions of the Dragonheirs beyond — thus was the curtain raised on the turning of the tide. Vol. 2 A chronicle that ordinary folk have been forbidden to read. The writing is a mix of fables and histories from the beginning of the world to the creation of the Dainichi Mikoshi . —Before Sun and Moon— What we wish to record is the tale of how heaven's will took shape on the earth below. O heavenly gods, these creations are your works. Grant us divine wisdom — let us endlessly record! "When the Doves Held Branches" When the eternal throne of the heavens came, the world was made anew. Then the true lord, the Primordial One , came forth and did battle against the seven terrifying sovereigns , dragon-lords of the old world. The Primordial One created shining shades of itself, and the number of these shades was four. "On Phanes, or The Primordial One" The Primordial One may have been Phanes. It had wings and a crown, and was birthed from an egg, androgynous in nature. But for the world to be created, the egg's shell had to be broken. However, Phanes, the Primordial One, used the eggshell to separate the "universe" and the " microcosm of the world ." "Forty Years After the Held Branches" Forty winters entombed the flames, and forty summers churned the seas. The Seven Sovereigns were vanquished, and the seven nations submitted to the heavens. The Primordial One, the great sovereign, began the creation of heaven and earth for "our" sake — that of its creations which it cherished most, who would soon appear upon this earth. ... "Four Hundred Years After the Held Branches" The mountains and rivers were made, and the seas and oceans accepted those who rebelled and those who would not kneel. The Primordial One and one of its shades created the birds of the air, the beasts of the earth, and the fish of the sea. Together, they also created flowers, grass, and trees, before finally creating humans — our ancestors, numerous as the stars in the sky, uncountable as the sand on the shore. From that time, our ancestors made a covenant with the Primordial One, and so entered into a new age. "The Year of the Ark's Opening" The Primordial One had a sacred plan for humans. As long as they were happy, it too rejoiced. "The Year After the Ark's Opening" The people worked the land, and so came the first harvest. The people mined, and so reaped the first crop of precious ore. The people gathered, and the first poems were written. "The Year of Jubilee" If there was hunger, the heavens would bring down food and rain. If there was poverty, the earth would bring forth its riches. If melancholy were to spread, the heavens would reply with their voices. The one taboo was to succumb to temptation. But the path to temptation had already been sealed. ... "The Funerary Year " The second throne of the heavens came , and war was rekindled, as it was in the world's creation. That day, the heavens collapsed and the earth was rent asunder. Our ancestors and their ancestral land fell into this place during that conflict. The era of darkness had begun. "The First Year of Darkness" The people of the Seven Sovereigns had found refuge in the oceans, and the Dragonheirs of the Depths ruled this particular place, which led to war between them and our ancestors. Our ancestors chased them into the shadows with the light of a thousand lanterns, and they hid in those shadows, hunting us. But there was only darkness in this place, and so their hunting grounds were untrammeled. The prayers of the people turned into lamentations, but the Primordial One and its three other shining shades could not hear. "The Parable of the Sun" In a dark cavern, there lived a group of people who had never seen the light. Among them was a sage who had once seen the sun, and he told the gathered folk about what life under the sun was like, and about the great might of the sun. Seeing that they did not comprehend, he lit a torch — and thus did people come to worship the flame, believing it to be the sun. They even got used to a life of darkness and fire. When the sage died, someone would monopolize the flame. Using it, they would cast a long shadow over the land. "The Parable of the Lethied Lotus" A lotus that causes all who look upon it to forget their troubles. A ship captain searching for the way back to the surface discovered a tribe of people who ate these lotuses. Some crew members stayed in that place. Others rejected that temptation. Life is a boundless ocean of suffering. We are only searching for the way home. "The Third Year of Darkness" We knew the only one who had not forsaken us as the "Ruler of Time." She was the moment. She was every moment. She was the measure of a thousand winds and the sun and the moon. She was every second of joy, every moment of rage, every instant of longing, every minute of obsession. She was every flash of delirium. We call her Kairos, or "the ruler of the unchanging world." We dare not speak her true, secret name, and so I pen it here, only once, and in reverse: " Htoratsi ." "The Year of Blindness" The sage Abrax 's wisdom was awakened, and he unveiled a light-bringing miracle from within his hands. So our ancestors began to build the Helios , with him as their leader. "The Year of Sight, or the First Year of Sun and Moon" Helios, the divine chariot of the sun, was finally completed. The Whitenight came, and Evernight was banished. The years of the Sun and Moon had begun. "The Second Year of Sun and Moon" Our ancestors sought the returning way, for surely the war on the surface had ended by then. But the Primordial One, the first throne, had laid down a ban, preventing our ancestors from finding the path home. In that case, the Primordial One must have defeated the Second Who Came. Abrax was imprisoned by order of the Sunchild . "The Parable of the Tree" The king's gardener and the tree spirit of the royal garden were in love. But the king wished to repair the beams of his pavilion, and so needed to cut down the tree with the most spiritual energy within it. The king was the incarnation of the Primordial One, and the gardener could not defy the sovereign of sovereigns, and so he could only bring his plea to the king's priest, who was the incarnation of Tokoyo Ookami. The priest had pity on the gardener and said to him: "Go, and cut the branches of the spirit-tree down." The gardener did so, and afterward did as the king ordered, cutting the spirit-tree itself down. Then the priest said: "Plant the spirit-tree's branches in the ground." But the gardener said: "A spirit-tree shall take five hundred years to grow." The priest said: "Your one thought shall echo through eternity." And so the gardener planted the branches in his back yard. In an instant, the slim branches grow into a new tree, and the new tree spirit was a continuation of the past one. For it is the God of Moments who is able to take "seeds" from this "moment" into the past and the future. The Tenth Year of Sun and Moon Abrax is long gone. The events before the sun and the moon have been recorded sufficiently. Well, if I did not dare to write things down just as they happened, how could I consider myself a scribe of Tokoyo Ookami? Hark, I hear armor without. Here, I shall stop writing. Vol. 3 This text records the geography and hydrology of Byakuyakoku . With the sealing of the depths and the emigration of the people of Watatsumi, as well as the passing of long years, this book is now useless. —Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku— The lands beneath the aphotic depths are vastly different from those on the surface, to the extent that all surface-derived common sense must be abandoned down below. All we formerly knew of land and sea was given unto us directly by the heavens . In this new world of ours, we must begin groping even for the simplest methodologies anew. O you who come after and read these words, do not take the life you lead for normalcy. Even if after a hundred or a thousand years, people should grow used to life down here, always remember — these days with neither sun nor moon are abnormal. Even if some sage were to draw us the sun, there will surely be filthy wretches who will borrow its light to cast long shadows over us. This book is intended to help people understand the world they live in, and to never forget our desire to return to the light. (This book has been constantly edited, redacted, and modified over the years. Even the name of the book's title has seen change from "Aphotic Earth" to "Tokoyokoku," before becoming "Byakuyakoku." Later, due to the grace of Watatsumi , the people of the depths would return to the sea's surface. But it seems like "Aphotic Earth" has some special meaning, and it has not been universally changed throughout the text.) Of Wind and Water Byakuyakoku has no mountains to speak of, and so it is pointless to speak of them. However, our priests and sages have detected something. Even in these depths, the power of the "undying wind" and the "water" still remain. The personification of the "undying wind" is known as " Tokoyo Ookami ," and is poetically rendered " the thousand winds " or "the thousand winds of time." "Water," on the other hand, is the might of the Vishap Realm , represented by the Bathysmal Vishaps . We have already developed a certain field of study regarding the relationship between Sunfire, wind, and water. As such, both hydrology and the undying wind must be considered before undertaking any project of civil engineering. The Borders of Byakuyakoku The borders of Byakuyakoku are marked out by three corners. These mark the limits of the see-saw clash between humanity and the vishaps . During the era of Byakuyakoku, Towers of the Three Realms were built at these three corners , used to harmonize the three realms . Their ancient names have been lost to time, and they were renamed after the coming of Watatsumi . These towers are exceedingly important, and they are not in locations aligned with either wind or water. Rather, their purpose is to stabilize the tendencies of Byakuyakoku and control its winds and waters. If these towers were to be imperiled, so would the entire nation. As such, they have been hidden using secret arts. Only the shrine maidens and the Vassals of Watatsumi can summon them forth . The Narrows The Narrows were, in the earliest times, sandwiched between the mountain face and an area known as the Roundlands, thus earning that location its name. However, the exceedingly strange tectonic shifts in Byakuyakoku caused the Roundlands to collapse into the depths, thus causing The Narrows to widen significantly. The Serpent's Heart From the first time our ancestors discovered this place, it had already played host to a unique phenomenon in which space itself might overlap in a certain locale. Later, those who came before us would utilize this phenomenon by creating the Serpent's Heart. It would be used to guard secrets, imprison criminals, and worship the great imaginary serpent, Ouroboros. In the earliest times, this place was called Delphi, the land of snakes. This name did not change even after the arrival of Watatsumi Omikami. Ancient art depicts the scaleless serpent as "Ouroboros," and the coral-adorned serpent as "Orobashi." Dainichi Mikoshi The earliest name of this place was "Helios," and it was the high tower built by the sage Aberaku , standing for earth, the element between wind and water. According to prophecy, this was likely the sun that the sage displayed, used to light those lightless caverns. And just as those prophecies suggested, it was also later used to cast a great shadow over the nation. Vol. 4 Experimental Records of the Bathysmal Vishaps . No vishaps were killed in the writing of these records. —Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records— ...Effective today, all experiments regarding the Dragonheirs will be directed by Watatsumi Omikami in person. All files preceding the founding year of the Watatsumi calendar have been destroyed. Dossier serial numbers shall no longer use the categories Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon, which used the ancient Watatsumi tongue. Instead, we shall use Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Ether, and Void going forward. &#91; Note 1 &#93; All quotes and notations are to be written within quotation marks (""). The following order of writing should be observed: File Header-Serial Number-Subject-Author. Author can be omitted, or their internal title within the research lab may be used. Usage of a researcher's ancient Byakuyakoku/Enkanomiya name or modern Watatsumi/Narukami/Inazuman name is forbidden. These experimental records are not to be used for the writing of diaries, love letters, or fantasy novels. ... The Dragonheirs' (hereafter named Bathysmal Vishaps or plain vishaps) evolution is plain for all to see. ("Water-101-Dragonheir Evolution: I") We have tried lowering the temperature in the living environs of a young heat-resistant vishap. As a result, they were weaker once matured. We suspect that this is because its body did not possess the "seed" required to resist such an environment. However, its descendants would all possess high body fat, greater predilection towards sleep, and would express the Cryo element. (Please refer to the experimental data after the main text. The abnormal data derived from Sample 3 is due to my assistant feeling sorry for the subject of the anti-hunger control group and feeding it surreptitiously.) When we then placed their descendants into sweltering conditions, they would again choose, like their ancestors, the heat resistance trait. However, none of them have developed traits indicative of the Pyro element thus far. We do not have enough data to reach a conclusion at present, but we can make an educated guess that Bathysmal Vishaps have the ability to awaken their "seed" freely before maturation. Vishap mothers can also create new "seeds" to pass on to their descendants should they encounter heretofore unseen, challenging environments. It can be said that even before encountering us, the people of Enkanomiya, the Bathysmal Vishaps had already stored a veritable armory within their bodies. ... The results of the intelligence tests are astonishing. ("Void-207-Vishap Intelligence Research"). Through a screening process consisting of rewards and punishments (although previous research indicates that screening is unnecessary — vishaps are, one and all, adapters par excellence), the linguistic capacities of vishaps four generations down are starting to approach that of a 12-year-old human student. Perhaps it might be more accurate to say that vishaps always had their own methods of communication, and what they are displaying here is their ability to learn. We believe that these experiments should be stopped. If not, we may yet be proven narrow-minded for having dismissed that last person who wrote a fantastical tale about vishap-people . Prophecy holds that the Dragon Sovereign of Water will be born in a human form . We must not let this thing happen in Enkanomiya. ... All previous attempts at grafting have failed. ("Void-907-Watatsumi Omikami's Special Orders: I"). Because they cannot accept Watatsumi Omikami's blood , the vishaps will fall victim to various adverse effects. Perhaps they are not yet strong enough, but we cannot be sure — indeed, according to our rationalized vishap evolutionary roadmap, we should have already bred the strongest vishap possible. ... The grafting can be considered a success. ("Void-907-Watatsumi Omikami's Special Orders: III"). The rejection originates from the vishaps having been beings of the Light Realm (also known as elemental creatures), and thus being at odds with the Human Realm , of which Omikami and its coral vassals are a part. All experimental logs are closed. No experiment conducted here resulted in the death of any Dragonheirs — they all lived to see the end of their days. Praise be to Watatsumi Omikami, gracious and beneficent. Vol. 5 A puzzle book for children of ages nine to twelve. As a book from a transitory period, it uses Narukami-style names with Byakuyakoku subscripts. —In the Light, Beneath the Shadow— Question 1: What walks on four feet in the early morning, two feet during the day, and three feet at night? Answer: A vishap who transforms into a person to attend a ball, then breaks one of its legs and eventually ends up walking with a cane. Sages like this answer the most, and it is the children get it right almost exclusively. For adults, it always smells like a horrible conspiracy when a vishap turns into a human. According to a prophecy of old, the Dragon of Water , the ancient lord of vishaps, will definitely descend in the form of a human . However, for children, the answer to the question indicates the possibility of mutual understanding. But it is not a good idea to make vishaps sound adorable. Though such jokes defang the fear, they also lower the guard of the children. ( Dragonheirs of the Depths have evolved to wield the power of other elements and have hence lost their purity. As such, the Dragon of Water will no longer be born from among their ranks.) Question 2: With only one mouth, this being sometimes has four feet, sometimes, two feet, and sometimes, three feet. Though unable to morph into other things, it is able to walk on the earth, swim in the water, and fly in the sky. The more feet it walks on, the feebler it grows. What is this being?Answer: A human. Humans crawl on hands and feet as babies, walk on two legs as adults, and use a cane as elders. The answer is undoubtedly "a human." Question 3: What talks with only one mouth but walks on four and two feet? Answer: Someone raising livestock. This riddle is a very ancient one. In the past, we could only understand the meaning of livestock from reading texts. "Four legs" refers to four-legged animals like the Aux, Hors, and Foreste Bore . After Byakuyakoku fell into the ocean depths, these animals died out within two generations due to a lack of habitable land and food. Since the arrival of Watatsumi Omikami , some of us have returned to the sea's surface to build a home and interact with the people there. Therefore, we have been able to review the names of these animals. According to the Vassal and the Omikami's prophecy, we shall all move back to the sea's surface someday, so it is important to get these names right. Aux means cattle, Hors means horse, and Foreste Bore means forest boar. Question 4: Who are the two sisters who give birth to each other every day? Answer: Day and night, or Whitenight and Evernight. This riddle is easy to understand. It alludes to the succession of day and night, which in Byakuyakoku means the cyclical Whitenight and Evernight under the control of the Dainichi Mikoshi . Though the land was in everlasting night before the Dainichi Mikoshi was built, the light of day that people had seen has remained unchanged. By the way, the two special astronomical phenomena of Byakuyakoku — the mirages and the Sinshades — were at first indiscriminately referred to as Eidolons and seen as the two sides of the same coin. It was not until the arrival of Watatsumi Omikami that the people of Byakuyakoku were able to understand the two phenomena and name them differently. Though the sun did not shine upon Byakuyakoku, the mirages that appeared in Whitenights were named Sunfire Phantasms and those of Evernight, Ghostfire Phantasms. As time went by, both of them came to be referred to as Sunfire Phantasms, for they are essentially the same thing. Question 5: I am the Shadowborn of the Lord of Light. I am a wingless bird that rises from the earth to the sky. Those who shed tears in my presence feel no sorrow in their bosoms. Away with a gentle breeze I fade, and thus ends my fleeting life. Answer: The answer is smoke. Birds are winged creatures, and it is normal that they are not seen in Enkanomiya. Question 6: A father has twelve children, each then giving birth to sixty daughters of different appearances. Of them, thirty are pale and thirty are dark. The whole family, knowing not death, will only fade away. Who is the father? Answer: The answer is the year. The people of Byakuyakoku may find the part about sixty pale or dark granddaughters a bit confusing. But everything will start to make sense once they crack Question 4. There used to be a sequel to this riddle in ancient times. It roughly said that every granddaughter would give birth to twelve descendants, and each of them would then have sixty children. Every such child later would give birth to another sixty, who would go on to have children of their own. This would continue until at last, all the offspring would together give birth to the one and only primordial child — Tokoyo Ookami , the "mother" of fourteen billion years. Watatsumi Omikami forbade people from spreading this riddle. ...

The writing style seems to give off a strange and ominous aura. Once, in a dream, I saw a black ship. It sailed through dark night and bleak fog. The hull was rotten, the mast shattered, Yet in some perverse jest at human rationality, Each broken piece had been placed in some twisted way, Entwined together by the algae and seaweed that enveloped the vessel, Forming a dreadful dark shadow that shambled through the moonlight, That none could glimpse and not panic. Shift your gaze just a little, and in an instant, It shall appear again just before you. A tall and slim figure standing upon the deck, Wrapped in dark robes, its face barely seen. Only its eyes, those two cold eyes, Which can pierce your soul with a glance. Was that a monster that arose from the depths of the sea? A lord returned from some ancient world? Or perhaps the nightmare itself? Vol. 2 A poem penned by an author unknown. The writing style seems to give off a strange and ominous aura. By the banks of the world's purest lake , There once stood a glistening castle . Gold leaf and gems decorated its walls, And it shone blinding in the post-noon sun. Pretty banners and flags flew from the roof, While majestic towers soared alongside. Guests from afar peered through colorful windows, And marveled at the wonders every step revealed. Yet none was more marvelous than the many statues , Odd in form but as real as life. In the center of the hall sat a golden stage, Where musicians played day and night for the castle's master . As the music sounded, listeners flocked like swarming bees , To dance in time with the beat that seemed to captivate the entire world. The wine flowed never-ending to sate the thirst for revelry. All could partake, no matter their class or their homeland, But none of this could ease the master's fears, Or bring his troubled soul a moment of peace. And each time the tower's clock struck its deep midnight chime, He would be possessed by an uncontrollable panic, Trapped by his fears and his gloom. The dark-robed figure would surely collect on debts owed, And all before his eyes would be turned into dust, The souls of his guests, and his own, included, As tribute to that dark, ancient world . Vol. 3 A poem penned by an author unknown. The writing style seems to give off a strange and ominous aura. At first, all was still, apart from the curtains in the breeze, And the faint sounds of animals chewing, echoing through the walls of some unknown place. Then, an odd rasping laugh erupted from an empty room, A nameless horror spreading in the dark. Then, with terrible thunder and storm, A glowing red fog-cloud, Embraced the castle just like a shroud. On the castle's great central stage, a tall thin figure did appear, A dark spirit in black robes, arriving at last. The guests, a moment ago enjoying their revels, Fell to the floor one by one, Bereft of time even to scream. The master sat shivering and still on his throne, His soul also snatched by the dark. Amid the roar of brick and tile hitting the ground, The castle's glory faded into the past, Swallowed by glimmering waves. The blood moon the towers once blocked reappeared in the sky, Its baleful glow sweeping the land. And today, by the banks of the world's purest lake, The water reflects the long-fallen, faded castle. The joy and brilliance that once lit its halls, Consigned to legends and dreams. The ruins lie suffocated in the gloom. Through shattered windows, statues appear as like to monsters, Who with the discordant tune that played sank with the castle into the sea. There is nothing there now, bar darkness, death, and loss.

Fontainian science fiction novel published by The Steambird . It tells the story of an engineer's travels using a time machine. This is a story from many years ago. After the evening banquet, Ms. Aviva (who today would be Lady Nenonen) was, as always, theatrically grousing to us about the all-too-swift march of science. Though her grasp on engineering is even less firm than her knowledge of Watatsumi Island 's soil quality (and of course, she knows nothing about the latter either), but self-proclaimed interest in engineering was in vogue amongst some ladies and gentlemen at the time. "Our ancestors had already conquered this land thousands of years ago," she said as she cleared her throat, twirling her jade-plumed and blue-gem-encrusted folding fan while endeavoring in vain to wear a visage of despondency. "And a few hundred years ago, they conquered the oceans with ease using new diving equipment. Today, some noble young folk have suddenly got it in their heads to use a so-termed gravimeter to break free from the earth's shackles and conquer the skies — and surely, I fear, their dream may yet become reality in the near future." "Indeed, it is just as you say. Humans — ah, what a mighty and energetic species, with such great wisdom! No matter the circumstances, humans ever seek to change their living conditions with unimaginable passion," The Steambird editor immediately opined. "In truth, when it comes to mechanical engineering and theory, humanity is already on par with the creator. They have conquered most of the natural world, and by their will, they can shape this world anew." "Ah, that's... not what I meant to say," Ms. Aviva said with an affected sigh. "Those distant and dark unknown continents, those ruins hidden deep beneath the seas, all that romantic exploration and trailblazing — such great achievements, that which has put the glorious achievements of our sciences and reasoning on full display — have all but become lost to our civilization. Our forebears reached too high and achieved too much, leaving too little for us to explore or conquer. Could there be a sadder fate to befall those ladies and gentlemen amongst us who were born to crave the exploration of the unknown?" Here, her pretentious invocation of the legendary King Argeadai's words seemed an attempt to prove how truly this state of affairs hurt her. However, everyone simply sat around lazily, at most giving polite nods. Lady Elle lightly yawned. Seeing how no one answered, Ms. Aviva's enthusiasm faded and she proceeded to switch the topic to next week's ball. This was, evidently, a more popular topic, and the stiff atmosphere once again grew lively. Monsieur Ratar was just about to regale us with a tale he had heard in Sumeru regarding a tower, a mage, and a glass ball, but before he could begin, Mr. Ciric, who had remained silent till now, interrupted. "Good Ms. Aviva, the things you said certainly left an impression on me." He lit a cigarette. "However, you need not worry. There is still one space that has yet to be subdued by humanity — indeed, if the required techniques do not emerge, I fear it will never be." "Where's that?" Ratar asked, a sullen look on his face. He had been so very confident about his monkey story, after all. "Time." The room fell silent momentarily before all present broke out into laughter. "What preposterous talk!" Dr. Reinier declared, trying not to laugh. "Firstly, how can time be considered a part of space?" "Can you separate yourself from time and exist independently in space alone?" "What do you mean?" "I mean to, at this moment, still be speaking to me, and in the next disappear without a trace. Is this possible?" He waited for a moment, as if waiting for the others to think. "Obviously, anyone with the capacity for rigorous thought would know for certain that much like length, width, and height, time is also a dimension of space. As such, it is a part of nature, and can thus be conquered." "Utterly preposterous..." The doctor muttered, but did not refute the statement. "I have been involved in research of this sort for some time," he continued, "and I have come up with a machine that can allow people to travel through time as they please. This machine will be ready in two months. At that time, Ms. Aviva, I invite you and all the ladies and gentlemen present here to my workshop, to bear witness to humanity's next great achievement: the conquest of time." Ms. Aviva did not speak. In fact, from her expression, our noble friend did not understand Mr. Ciric's words at all. Vol. 2 A Fontainian science fiction novel published by The Steambird. It tells the story of an engineer's travels using a time machine. Two months later, we — The Steambird editor, the doctor, Mr. Revilo Oliver, and others who had attended that evening banquet — came to Ciric's workshop as agreed. Ms. Aviva was not there, for she never had much interest in such things, but instead found more meaning in attending a social ball at Salon Caritat . Surprisingly, Ciric had grown older and more frail in just two months. In the dim light of the lamp, his once enthusiastic, arrogant expression had hardened into something indifferent and solemn, almost like the emaciated ascetics of Sumeru . He welcomed us to take our seats, speaking in a calm tone. "Well then, how is your plan to conquer time progressing?" The Steambird editor asked directly. "Where is the time machine you spoke of?" Ciric did not reply. Instead, he pointed to the desk next to him. Our gazes followed, and in the middle of that table was a gold-plated whale-shaped model airship about the size of a small clock. Even a non-professional eye could readily discern that the model was of exquisite craftsmanship. Beneath its clear crystal shell, an indistinguishable and formless color flowed ever so slowly, glowing faintly in the lampshade's shadow. "So," the doctor said, "it took you two months to make this little toy that would amaze even Lepaute 's artisans?" "It certainly looks like nothing special," Ciric said, an inscrutable emotion shining in his eyes that could almost be called pity, "But this is simply a projection the object has left in this moment, just as one can only see a thin line when viewing paper from the side." "Blithering nonsense." For some reason, Ciric did not refute that statement, merely asking us in a calm tone to hear him out concerning his time travel experiences. We agreed, and so he began to tell the story I shall now relate below, without interruption from beginning to end. For all of you, it was two months ago when I first told you of the idea of a time machine. Similarly, it must have been a week ago when I finished constructing said device and stepped into it, initiating the very first instance of time travel in human history. The strange sensations that came over me as I traveled through time are beyond words, just as there are no words with which one can impress the stars' brightness upon a blind person. About twenty minutes after this — though describing time travel by using subjective time is quite meaningless — the machine ceased operation. I looked about me then, and realized that I was in a Remurian imperial settlement. The grand temples and arenas carved of titanic stone would make the Opera Epiclese hang its head in shame, while the creations of Alain Guillotin would be little more than a child's wind-up toy before the towering Remurian golems . Just as I was beside myself in awe, a few patrolling troops discovered me. Seeing my strange style of dress, they took me to be a spy for the barbarian tribes. They seized me, naming me a lowly slave, a degenerate believer in a false god , and threatened to throw me into a deep cistern to feed the vipers. Fortunately, the local Aedile — I later found out that her name was Aidia Anavana — realized that my identity was anything but ordinary, and had me sent before her. She endured my calamitous grammar and catastrophic accent (at that time, I could not even pronounce "Remuria," with it coming out something more akin to "Emuia") while asking me many questions, which I answered truthfully. Quickly, she accepted the fact that I was from the future and showed me a stone slate that the slaves had recently dug up. Vol. 3 A Fontainian science fiction novel published by The Steambird. It tells the story of an engineer's travels using a time machine. The slate was a perfect square, each line and column engraved with seven symmetrical sequences of symbols — these were not in Remurian script, but rather the characters we use today. Regardless of the manner in which the text was read, or the order, or direction, the information within the text did not change — it was an elaborate riddle involving dogs , pastures, cyan finches , the summer rains, the song of the roses, a Rishboland Tiger 's stripes, and the ordered patterns of rocks. Despite my long-time love of wordplay games, this endless cycle of riddles made me terribly dizzy. For some reason, I knew that I must solve it, no matter the price. I spent half a year doing so alongside Aidia — and as it turned out, the key to deciphering it lay with the name of a slave now thirty years dead, while the answer was a date, set several hundred years after the empire's fall. I bade Aidia farewell and stepped back upon the time machine, forwarding myself to that date in hopes of finding the secret behind that stone slate. There, I met several Marechaussee Hunters , and they showed me another stone slate, which again had 49 mirrored characters on it that formed another riddle. Again, the answer was a date, one set in a future still further off. Following these stone slates' directions, I cris-crossed the fabric of past and future, shuttling back and forth 13 times. Each stone slate's riddle was trickier than the last. One of them could only be cracked using a bad romance novel that would only be published 300 years hence — the 5th word of the 37th page of that book would form a conjugate with the full name of the 375th Maison Gardiennage officer from 375 years ago. Another riddle's cipher was based on a white flower that will only bloom several millennia in the future — I know not its name, and its pistil structure is very strange indeed. It might be a mallow of some sort, but I cannot be sure. That flower is nourished by skylark calls, and so one of the clues to its cipher was the number of ribs on a skylark during Remurian times. I suppose that is, generally speaking, just how the riddles worked. The final stone slate came from the underground storeroom of the Basil Elton Memorial Museum, and had naught but one number on it: "0." I do not know what I was thinking at the moment. After all, setting my destination to "0" is an action utterly devoid of meaning. But I punched the number into my machine all the same and pulled the control lever. After who knows how long, the machine stopped. I sensed that I was floating atop a sea with no waves or tides, for even the wind did not exist at that moment. The sky that loomed overhead was not blue, but a dark red adorned with countless stars, pale and distant, like salt frost lining the shore. I stared at this very first of oceans, transfixed, and several minutes passed before I realized that there was something shadowy hidden beneath the placid surface. It was the Palais Mermonia , which should not be there. At that moment, I could hear someone call me by name — Neven Ciric, the voice called. I turned, and it was like looking into a mirror. A man, identical to myself, looking me dead in the eye, just as I did to him. "Neven Ciric," he continued, "you wish to conquer time. No one can do that." "It was you who left those riddles behind?" "It was you who left those riddles behind." He repeated my question as if it was an answer. "Those riddles are part of time, and every matching symbol is time itself." "So, the final answer to the riddle of time is zero." "Zero is not an answer. Instead, it is another mystery, for the answer cannot be found in the riddle," he said. "The answer to time's riddle is a mirror — or perhaps I should say that this is the answer that is simplest to comprehend. When two mirrors face each other, time is the infinite reflection of light therein. Countless diverging, converging, and parallel lights form the illusion we call time. There is no past or future, for the past is the future. As you stand here at Moment Zero and look forward along the gap between the two mirrors, all beams of light fall along the same plane, and not one may escape. The Palais Mermonia had already sunk long before it was ever built, and the sunken Palais will be raised anew. Joy, sorrow, tears, and death must infinitely recur, for this is the nature of a mirror. Similarly, you can never conquer time, just as you can never grasp your shadow in your hand." Perhaps it was horror or momentary frenzy, but when he finished, I whipped out the firearm I kept for self-defense, leveled it at his head, and pulled the trigger. The room was silent. "I do not expect you to believe me," Ciric said as he stood up, his eyes sweeping the room. "Just take it as a bunch of bunk that I made up to cover up for my inability to make a time machine. Make of it some lame tale, a dream born purely of delusion. In any case, ladies and gentlemen, I shall take my leave of you — my future self awaits a riddle that I must set him." I never saw Ciric Neven again.This text is also known as "Hleobranto Innamorato." The author of the first edition claims to have based this tale on a legendary story known throughout Khaenri'ah , but there are none left who can verify this. It is an anthological work produced over several generations at this point. This is a story from very ancient times indeed. It is said that in those days, birds had not yet split into domestic and wild kindreds. In those days, a crimson moon shone down upon the subterranean realm, and not the dark sun of latter days. Due to the Kingdom's unique position, things from outside this world were always leaking into it. The Kingdom's weapons would wipe out the calamities slipping in, but what of all the other objects? Such as, say, a child who may have come from some destroyed world? One of the sages spoke thusly to the great ruler: "Oh high lord of the nobles, a child once told me a tale of another world: Once upon a time, there were sea people who believed that the gods came from the sea. Each time they discovered a shipwrecked person, they would treat them with the utmost honor, for they believed that the gods would take the form of the shipwrecked to investigate the mortal realm." The ruler replied, "I do not perceive your meaning, so do as you please." (Naturally, no oceans in the traditional sense lay within the Kingdom's borders. The earliest founders of the Kingdom had once seen the majestic silhouettes of the mountains blur under the sun's searing glare, and the rippling reflections of the moonlight falling upon the sea's surface like a scattering of pearls. But at the time the story took place, only outsiders and those few who had left the Kingdom on official duties and returned could describe such sights to the ruler. The ocean and the sea were often used as a metaphor for the space projected by the stars.) In anticipation of the arrival at their Kingdom of gods from beyond the so-called ocean — or rather, the arrival of beings who could transcend the gods — they founded an organization, an orphanage to take care of such children. In latter days, the orphans of the Kingdom and those who wandered in from outside were accepted as well. The young Perinheri's first memory was that of being asked by the grown-ups to crawl through a dark corridor. This passage might have been a chimney for winter fires, for it was filled with coal ash, and there was not a single crack in it through which smoke or light could pass through. As he crawled, he would sometimes stumble in the pitch-black darkness. Fortunately, the corridor appeared designed for the passage of children in the first place, so the falls were not very painful. It also lacked any annoying cobwebs. When Perinheri reached the end at last, the exit had not opened yet. He knocked, only for the grown-ups to coldly ask: "Are you dead?" Well, how was he to reply if he was dead? But the grown-ups did not like this response. They kept asking the same question, until he at least shouted, "Yes, I'm dead!" The adults then asked, "Did you see it, then?" Perhaps it was the fear brought on by the darkness combined with hunger and exhaustion, but Perinheri did indeed see an illusion. The crimson moon , hanging high in the pitch-dark night sky, suddenly turned around, revealing itself to be a titanic, horrified eye. The adults opened the door and embraced the soot-covered Perinheri: "You have traversed the fire of two worlds within the hearth, and here you are reborn." Though the crimson moon set, and the dark sun descended into a yet darker dusk, that transcendental person from beyond who the Kingdom orphanage was awaiting never arrived. But unusual individuals they had aplenty, and many of those who strode forth from the gates of that orphanage became great knights of the Kingdom. Perinheri was, in his time, the leading figure amongst their ranks — that is, unless, he were forced to compete with his best friend, Hleobrant. They should have competed for glory, and decided who was superior through the amount of honors they crowned themselves in — and in the number of goblets of fine wine downed during the festivities afterward. But for some reason, their rivalry would take a mortal turn. Vol. 2 This text is also known as "Hleobranto Innamorato." The author of the first edition claims to have based this tale on a legendary story known throughout Khaenri'ah, but there are none left who can verify this. It is an anthological work produced over several generations at this point. That day, the orphanage welcomed a new member. She was a beautiful young lady from a foreign land who claimed to be a noble princess. Her nation had been defeated by Deus Auri , and yet the daughter of a priestly line she remained, and would not submit to the new god , and so she had drifted, wandering through the gates of their Kingdom. She called herself Angelica (Note 1), meaning "one who is as a divine emissary." Fair Angelica declared that she would only marry the mightiest knight in all the Kingdom. Perinheri cared not a whit, but Hleobrant was smitten with her. Angelica would often take walks near the Sea of Wells, and there she spoke much of the outside world to Hleobrant. Perinheri would come along out of concern for his friend, and because suspicion was born in him sooner than curiosity, he would doubt her every word, yet wished that he might see these things one day. Angelica's arrival changed Hleobrant altogether. He would cause trouble, looking for any provocation upon which to stake a duel against other knights. He would win all these bouts, and turn to Angelica to show off his prowess. Yet all she ever gave him was a cool smile, for what great feat was it for a great runner if they raced a tortoise and triumphed? "Njord, who walks with the Darksprites (Note 2), Alf, the greatest warrior in the Universitas Magistrorum , Alberich , commander of half the knights, and Perinheri the undefeated." Angelica spoke thus of the mightiest figures in the Kingdom as she saw them. Having fallen head over heels into the throes of love, Hleobrant came to what was an all-too-reasonable conclusion for himself. People might call him a traitor, or believe him mad. But even so, he had no wish to hurt Perinheri. As for Perinheri, he believed that his best friend's madness would be cured, if only he could kill Angelica. In the midst of that most merciless of pursuits, the three left the Kingdom's borders. At that very moment, Hleobrant clutched his face, and the words escaping his mouth gradually grew more like the howling of a wild beast . The witch, Angelica, explained thus: "Hleobrant is the descendant of those who forsook their god and came to the Kingdom. This is why the Kingdom's obstinately pure-blooded aristocracy persists. This is the price of betraying your own god." "As for you, Perinheri, you are one who drifted there. Thus, you bear no such curse. You may not have the nobility to shoulder a world, but you too have your own destiny." "And as for me? I betrayed no one, not for a moment, until my god died, so I too bear this curse not. But you now see who I truly am, yes?" The sun rose over the horizon at that moment, and Perinheri's blade slipped from his fingers, exhausted from the night-long battle. Covering his forehead with the back of his hand, he looked upon the sun for the first time. And when he glanced back at Angelica, he saw that she was neither a beautiful woman from Liyue nor a wicked witch. "I am freedom, that which has broken free of fate. This is what Hleobrant sought in agony, but that which is now yours for the taking." There was nothing before Perinheri, only vast, empty land. Note 1: Note that the ancient people of Liyue did not use such names. Now that I consider it, her name may have been "Lady Miaoyin" (Lady of Wondrous Sound) or "Tianwang Nu" (Servant of Tianwang). Note 2: The black wolves of the first edition. Archaeological work on Khaenri'ah indicates that this must have been a type of warbeast created using alchemy.

There is no way to verify the truth of the words within. From time immemorial, those respected poets, playwrights, and historians have loved to write that which is utterly absurd and have the temerity to call it their real experiences. Anyone who cares to look can tell it's a pack of lies, and still, they insist on extravagantly embellishing everything while bending over backward to maintain a facade of sincerity, swearing that "I saw it all with my own eyes! Not a word of it is false!" as though they cared not an iota how they would be ridiculed in the ages to come. For example, Xanthus Talassii filius wrote of his meetings with the barbarians in the north, speaking of how they used glass and platinum to build their prosperous polis amongst the mountains, calling their king a "knight." He even claimed that they have seventy-two legions, each comprised of 66,600 soldiers, all armed with weapons forged of the purest of sourcewater , brighter even than the crystals of Machimos . In reality, he has not in his life even set foot outside of Capitolium . Forget barbarians, he's probably never even seen barbecued eel! However, it must be said his stories are interesting at least. As such, to satiate my own vanity, I felt I too must write something for posterity. However, I have no experiences worth mentioning and am unlike those respectable folks who name the cock and bull stories they concoct "true accounts." So I will freely and honestly admit that everything I write is completely, utterly fabricated. After all, since I've admitted it up front like this, nobody can call me a fraud. Anyway, the events I shall now commit to paper have never been heard of before, nor experienced by anybody, and are nothing more than pure nonsense that I have fabricated with no basis in reality. It is not more truthful than tales of "Lochknights," so you need not believe any of it. Thus, we weighed anchor and set sail, traveling ever northward, passing through the territory of the barbarians, with a tailwind spurring us on. Our goal was simple: To see just what the edge of the ocean looks like. According to Quinctilius , the High Sea ends in impassable waterfalls in every direction, but this was, evidently, utterly wrong: after all, did not the respected Iuvenalis also write of the " faraway kingdom in the north "? Anyway, the farther north we went, the less land we saw. At first, there were still clusters of islands and archipelagos covering the sea's expanse, but later there were little more than tiny bare isles dotting the waves remaining. A few days of sailing later, even those islets vanished, leaving nothing but boundless blue. Fortunately, we had brought sufficient supplies of fresh water and food, and were in no danger of dying from thirst or starvation. We sailed for 79 days without sight of land. We were originally planning on turning back at that point, but to our surprise, on the 80th day, in the middle of the ocean, we were attacked. A group of bandits riding on the backs of giant birds blocked our path and asked us for potatoes. If you wish to know just how gargantuan those birds were, I can tell you that each of their feathers was as thick as the Ocean Pillars. With absolutely no hope of resisting, all we could do was fall to our knees and pray to Sebastos to deliver us, to let us live another day, and we swore to never again travel so recklessly, or write baffling believe-it-or-not travelogues. But in a flash, faster than words could describe, warriors riding Blubberbeasts surged up from beneath the sea's surface, each Blubberbeast larger than fifty Sumpter Beasts , their entire bodies draped in armor made of crystals, the scales of dragons , and cabbages , and they tore into the massive birds, biting them until they cried for their mommies and daddies, and soon they fled without a trace. It was only then that we noticed that the appearance of those knights was completely different from that of us humans. They were more like bipedal vishaps . With those eyes of his, glowing with their strange light, the leader of the knights spent some time sizing us up, before casually speaking with winged words: "Dear guests, are you merchants from Serenum?" We had not the slightest clue what kind of place "Serenum" was, so we told him the whole story, that we were seafarers from Remuria , and wanted to see what the end of the ocean looked like. Vol. 2 An ancient Remurian scroll you accidentally discovered in the ruins. There is no way to verify the truth of the words within. Hearing our words, he burst into laughter, and he laughed so hard that even the sailfin on his back shook. As he howled with laughter, he managed to say that there's no such place as "Remuria," merely a fake history invented by the southern barbarians who, not having their own civilization, created a fictional empire that simply didn't exist. We said that no, we were Remurians, and he guffawed even louder, and asked us to provide some kind of reliable historical data or archaeological evidence that could prove Remuria really exists. We simply could not produce the proofs, and he assured us that these sorts of strange fantasies were not illegal in their lands, and so long as we did not eat Sunsettias in public, we would still be honored guests in their Empire of Solaris. He went on, saying that based on our clothing, we probably weren't secret agents of the rebel army, but were likely traveling traders from Hyperborea . Their empire was currently in a state of civil war, and they hoped we could assist them in defeating said rebels. It turned out that the Solaris Empire has very advanced technology, and some decades ago, a philosopher named Lucilius invented a way for some people to obtain extraordinary abilities far exceeding those of ordinary mortals. But it came at a price. Their appearance would change to be unlike those of ordinary people. Some believed that this practice destroyed the purity of humanity, and those with special powers had but two options: to be slaves, or to be destroyed utterly. And so the two sides quickly came to blows, and it was a fight to the death, with oceans of blood being spilled. I comforted him on the spot, telling him that in my opinion, this type of thing has been happening since ancient times. I could think of at least twenty plays on the spot, each revolving around this exact theme — this too was a reflection of just how the arts in Remuria were flourishing. Pisculentum 's Terentius at once praises humanity as being equal yet powerful creatures, while also describing how only a small number of people innately possess special powers, and has them go off and conquer and destroy all others, no? I recommended they just stop researching technology to alter humanity, and instead focus their efforts on technology to alter Blubberbeasts, as Blubberbeasts are far more likable than humans. He said he would consider my wise suggestion, but that the more pressing matter was exterminating the despicable traitors. So long as we were willing to lend a helping hand, he would give us the most powerful Imperial Blubberbeast mounts to ride, and we would lead thirteen of his legions, each with a million soldiers, for a total of 13 million soldiers, and outflank the enemy to their left. As he had saved us from a rebel attack, we assented to his request. Dear readers, everything I described above I saw with my own eyes! Not a word of it is false! As for the war that followed, it was even more unbelievable. I remember a blind slave who followed us singing thusly: "Sing, O musician, sing of the rage of the Blubberbeast which brought countless ills!" And just like that, the army of Blubberbeasts rolled forward, swallowing everything in its path like all-devouring flames, and the earth trembled and shook beneath their flippers. We arrayed our forces in formation upon the plains, and the leading officer prayed to their god before drawing taut a bowstring and loosing, sending a dog hurtling towards the rebel forces. The sound of the silver bow was unmanning to all who heard. But the rebels were not to be outdone, and they sent forth five million giants armed to the teeth. These giants were enormous, each dozens of times larger than the golems made by Sebastos's own hand, and they were said to be the reinforcements that the rebels had adjured forth from the seafloor. Though these giants each had but one eye — well, such things are quite normal, after all, the giants of which Pacuvius wrote are all like this — they had exceptional eyesight, and at the command of the rebel leader, they began to hurl Bulle Fruit at our troops with astonishing accuracy. These fruits would burst upon impact with the ground, spitting out masses of bubbles. Should you be touched by a bubble, you would float high up into the sky, until you flew straight into the sun. That is why the sun and Bulle Fruit have a similar color. As for the war's conclusion, respected playwrights throughout history virtually never write of such things — they wish to leave enough space for future stories. Out of respect for their traditions, therefore, I too shall go ahead and skip that part. Vol. 3 An ancient Remurian scroll you accidentally discovered in the ruins. There is no way to verify the truth of the words within. After those events, we continued sailing onward for another 300 days on a vast, featureless ocean. Finally, we arrived at a tall wall in the middle of the sea, stretching out of sight, high up into the sky. Countless densely packed human figures were suspended from the wall, and though they had neither bodies nor muscles, their forms could clearly be seen. All on this earth who speak lies, or pen falsehoods in their writings, will be hung from this wall to receive judgment after their death. As for who built this wall, or what lies beyond it, I do not know, for everything in this travelogue is completely true, and thus we had no way to get close to the wall. Hence, we promptly began rowing backward with all haste, doing our utmost to flee that place, and I hope to never again get anywhere close to it. That evening, we arrived in a stretch of calm seas, close to a rather small island. Our freshwater supplies were nearly exhausted, so we made landfall in the hopes of replenishing them. It was then that every member of our party smelled a strange yet rich fragrance, and even the finest perfumes of Capitolium paled in comparison. It turns out that the island was inhabited, and they had even built a prosperous polis — everything in the city was made of gold, and was surrounded by a series of twelve walls, each wall constructed of a different kind of precious gemstone: The first was made of amethyst, the second of purple agate, the third of jadeite, the fourth of rubellite, the fifth of jasper, the sixth of topaz, the seventh of ruby, the eighth of cornelian, the ninth of emerald, the tenth of chrysoprase, the eleventh of sapphire, and the twelfth of jade. A great moat surrounded the city walls, a few hundred meters wide, and the fluid flowing therein was not water, but fresh milk, and that which swam within were pickled fish, already fully cured, ready to eat upon capture. The residents of the island seemed to all be women, and each and every one was dressed elegantly, their faces comely and youthful. They approached us one after the other, taking the initiative and hugging us by way of welcome. The name of the island is Amoria, and they said it means "love." They eagerly invited us into their homes as guests, and said they'd give us countless treasures as gifts, enough for us to buy all of Machimos. I began to feel a faint sense of unease — for could people who fawn over strangers so exist outside of the books of Ennius ? But my companions were all quite familiar with those classic tales, and so found nothing strange at all about this, and followed them back to their homes. I had no choice but to feign delight on one hand, while secretly bringing with me the war booty the Solarians had presented me with: a Bulle Fruit. I followed one of the women back to her home, and once inside, I looked around carefully, and just as I expected, there were human bones all around. I promptly fished out the Bulle Fruit and took aim at her, demanding she tell me just what was going on. But she only laughed uproariously, turning into a pool of water and disappearing in the blink of an eye. I immediately gathered all my companions, and we fled back to our ship before we had a chance to gather any fresh water. But as we stared, there was no island at all, only the vast ocean behind us. As for how the story will unfold, pay close attention, for all will be revealed in the next chapter...One day, the mysterious Feline Firm sends an invitation to the doorman Perroux... Just what kind of adventures await him? On an afternoon much like many others, Perroux let out an extended yawn and was rubbing his eyes when he suddenly caught sight of a golden invitation lying silently in the flowerbed. Sunlight illuminated the card's cover, and the words emblazoned upon it — "To Monsieur Perroux" — shone brighter than scattered Mora. His eyes widened. He was but the humblest of bellboys, greeting every visitor who came calling at the Master's door with a respectful "Monsieur" or "Madame." This was the first time anyone had ever addressed him so politely as "Monsieur Perroux"! Who left it here? And without him ever noticing, too! He blinked a few times, then blinked again, confirming over and over that it was not some iridescent trick of the light. Then, he opened the invitation... "We are deeply grateful for the deliciousness you provided for us. Please do us the homor of paging us a visit. —Yours, The Feline Firm" The crooked lettering seemed as though it had been written with the coarsest of quill pens, and was utterly unsuited to the golden cover of the card. Feline Firm? Was there really some kind of firm named "Feline"? It couldn't really be an agency started by cats, right? Perroux did often feed the stray cats on the street with leftovers. Just call out "Kitty kitty, kitty kitty," and the cats would come running right over. However, without any food on offer, the cats would be quite cautious, even around Perroux. With that in mind, Perroux flipped the invitation over to look at the back. "Perhaps you are unfamiliar with our agency's location... At the twelfth turning of the north wind, follow the fish scales forward, and you will see a row of carriages. After the tenth chiming of the bells, there will be but one carriage left over. Jump into the shadows beneath it... We will be vaiting there..." Giving the time and location like that... Was this... some kind of nonsensical magic? Maybe someone was pranking him? Still, all the typos littered throughout the letter and the special attention to fish scales really did make it seem like a cat — That is, if cats could write and really had their own offices. North wind... fish scales... carriages... Oh, right! During the day, fishmongers set up their stalls twelve blocks south from where he was, and did the rubbish collection carriages not come every night at ten o'clock and stop there? They would take the massive heaps of trash generated in the city over the entire day outside, and then, at twelve, they'd come back, ""clickity-clack." Yes, this must be the language magic of cats! Only someone like Perroux who understood cats as well as he understood the city and understood the city as well as he understood its cats could decipher it. Perroux's heart began to pound, for this was a secret known only to him. "When it's time to change shifts, better hurry! Me, I've got an appointment to keep with the cats." Vol. 2 Having deciphered the Felinese spell, Perroux finds the entrance to the firm, and just like that, "jumps into the shadows beneath"... And then? "You're here! Please, have a seat." The cats were quite happy. "Yeah! It sure wasn't easy finding your offices." That night, Perroux had followed the directions given in the invitation, looking, searching. As it turned out, there was a single carriage among the trash carriages with a broken wheel that was always parked in place. Beneath it, he had found a dark hole that had merged with the shadows, with faint light and indistinct sounds coming from within, as well as a spiral staircase descending downward. And this was the well-hidden Feline Firm. "This is the nature of strays, please try to understand." Golden eyes narrowed, the cat with stripes like those of a tiger seemed to speak humbly, yet its tail was arched most proudly. Perroux recognized it immediately. This fellow would often laze about upon the Master's windowsill, languidly swishing his tail. As for the others, Perroux was not quite so familiar. The tiger-striped tabby cat introduced each of them: The Boss Cat, none other than the tabby himself. The Enforcer, the cat to the left with a full-sleeve tattoo. The calico to the right was quite clever. The letter to Perroux had been written by a brush fashioned from hairs pulled from every cat, and written by this very calico. "And then there's this firewood cat too. Bit ugly and mangy, missing some fur, but don't even think about underestimating her!" These were the very cats that comprised the Feline Firm, which solved the problems that perplexed the cats of the city. "In that case, just what difficulties has the Feline Firm resolved?" Perroux asked curiously. The tabby's tail twitched to the left, and the cat with the full-sleeve came forward. "I'm the muscle here, see? The full-sleeve they call me, yeah? Our Boss snorezilla over there, he gives me commissions, and I'm the one that what solves them, see?" "That cat boss, he opened up a right big fancy hotel, yeah? Every bit as tip-top as what the humans got~ When it first opened, was tons of customers t'be had." The cats even had their own grand hotel! Perroux nearly reached for his notebook to write it all down. Even Perroux had only passed by the door, peering inside with envy. That feeling was like... picking up a candy wrapper as a child, and being unable to stop himself from licking it. "But wouldn't-cha know, Boss's snoring was so roaring loud, the customers couldn't even catch a single wink! Business took a dive, see?" "Then one day, a horde of rats showed up and started bitin' them customer's things and whatnot, yeah? Then Boss showed them what for, was the hero, eh?" "After that, whenever customers heard his snores, theys would be at peace, and say 'good kitty, good kitty~'" "But yous see, that hotel didn't have any rats in the first place, yeah? It was all me, catchin' 'em at night and bringing 'em back, then catchin' 'em again, you follow?" Vol. 3 The cat with the full-sleeve arm tattoo completed the ever-snoring cat boss's commission, but what did the other do? Perroux's curiosity remained unabated... The full-sleeve cat finished its story, and the tabby's tail twitched to the right. The calico stepped forward elegantly, before delivering a graceful bow. "As they say, even amongst felines, there are lazybones too, meow~ "The lounging layabout outside the city gates sent us a commission for a one-and-done permanent mouse-catching method, meow~ "In accordance with my instructions, our paws-on-pillow friend changed the sign above his abode from 'Cat's Cabin' to 'Mousy Rest Stop,' meow~ "From then on, whenever rodents enter the city, mrow, they'll hear a gentle, friendly voice saying, 'Mice, rats, give your weary little paws a rest and apply some ointment, for your journey must have been tiring!' or 'Mice, rats, take those sharp little things off, and enjoy a good scrub down!' meow~ "And just like that, the mice scrub themselves with salt, smear themselves with oil, and line up to enter the hot water labeled 'Warm Bath' meow~ "And then, right into the mouth of our lazy friend, mrow!" With a "Pfft," Perroux failed to fully suppress his laugh. "Ah! What a clever calico!" The calico bowed gracefully once more, and returned to her place with the elegance of a noblewoman. "I—It's time for this loyal servant to speak now, isn't it..." The firewood cat spoke flatteringly. "The fur of your humble servant was burned away when I was seeking warmth in a pile of firewood... "It was really so strange. Your humble servant had just fallen asleep, and it was warm, so warm... one dreamt of being a kitten once more, and sleeping in mother's fur... As I slept, my fur caught fire... "Th—Thanks to the Boss's support, your humble servant often roams through the city sewers, delivering messages, passing info, running errands, that sort of thing, for I'm not afraid of getting dirty... "O—Other than that, I'm really isn't good for anything else..." The tabby cat cleared his throat, and the firewood cat flinched, smiling and quietly retreating. "Very well. You should now be well aware of the work we regularly do here at the Feline Firm. "We have invited you here because we've encountered an unsolvable problem, and would like to request your help, Monsieur Perroux!" Vol. 4 Even the Feline Firm, which has seen nearly everything, can find itself at a loss from time to time. Just what devilish difficulty has confounded the conceited tabby boss that he must seek succor from Perroux? "My help?" Perroux's eyes widened once more. The tabby solemnly nodded. "And it must be you, and none other. "In the house of the master you serve, there is a long-haired cat, is there not?" "Oh, that snow-white, noble-looking longhair!" It was well known to Perroux that the Master adored that cat, and it was as precious to him as life itself. Her sea-green eyes, like those of a princess of yore, were oft looking askance at people as she carefully groomed herself from whisker to tail with her peach-pink tongue, like a heron preening its feathers by the water. Whether taking his meals, his rest, or out on appointments, the Master always kept that cat by his side. "As for me, I'm going to get married to the long-haired cat, it's already been settled!" "Oh, married, that's... What? Ma—Ma—Married!?" In a whisker's twitch, Perroux became even more flustered than the firewood cat. "Th—Then how will you live together? Cats like her aren't the type to live like strays, you know!" "You needn't worry about that. After we are wed, we shall move to a shrine in a faraway land. I have heard that it is a cat shrine, and the people there worship cats like gods, and thus we shall worry for neither food nor drink..." "But th—th—that simply won't do! The Master will never let his longhair leave..." Perroux continued to stammer out his response. "So, Monsieur Perroux, that is precisely why we need you." The tabby jumped onto the cabinet, his golden eyes fixed on Perroux. "But I'm no respected gentleman, only a... lowly bellboy." Perroux kept waving his hands about together. "If I were to steal his cat... If the Master knew, not only would I lose my job, I would certainly be taken to court..." "No, no, you misunderstand, Monsieur Perroux!" The tabby showed a mysterious grin, the whiskers around its mouth trembling in the semblance of a smile. "We were never even considering asking you to steal, good sir. Cats are magical creatures, and we... have other ways..." Having spoken, the tabby whistled. And the full-sleeve and calico cats pulled out a pair of boots and a mask respectively, as if by magic. "These are magical cat boots and a mysterious cat mask. "Come now! Try them on!" Perroux had no choice but to take the treasures. But wait, though the boots seemed small, the moment he pulled them on, they became comfortable and fit snugly. And as he walked, he felt so light, as if he were tip-toeing... Putting on the mask, he tried to open his mouth to speak, but now some long, difficult-to-distinguishable trills accompanied the sound, and it sounded nothing like his own voice. "This is cat magic," the tabby cheerfully said, "As long as you wear these two items, none will recognize you. "All you need do is go home as always, and have yourself a good night's sleep. "After three days, bring the longhair cat and your Master both to the Feline Firm in accordance with our instructions! Remember, three days hence! "You mustn't forget!" Vol. 5 A cat's magical boots and a cat's mysterious mask. Just how will they bring the long-furred cat to the Feline Firm? A new invitation was sent, this one to the Master. "Master Baron, long have we heard of your esteemed cat. I also have a valuable and exotic cat, and hope that we may bond over our mutually shared appreciation for the feline race. It would be my great honor if you would do me the pleasure of calling upon my home such that we might discuss such things in person. "A carriage will take you and your cat there at the appointed time. — Lady von Frigga" Thanks to Perroux's guidance, the calico carefully corrected the typos. And then the cats got to work. Many cats who had once been recipients of the Firm's assistance came to help, bringing white satin, nearly-expired cans of snapper fish, wines... all to turn the agency into a wedding venue. Any passing by at night would be struck pale with fright to see so many stray cats passing by in the shadows of the city. The broken carriage was quietly repaired, and decorated like a gorgeous carriage straight out of a fairytale. With soft swan-feather pillows and the sort of wind chimes cats adore hanging from it ringing all the way, it arrived at the Master's stoop. "Please, if you would, Sir." Perroux respectfully addressed his Master with bowed head, acting as "Lady von Frigga's coachman." Though he was wearing the mysterious cat mask, Perroux could not help but feel nervous, as though he'd done something wrong, as though he had done something to give the whole game away. Fortunately, the Master had a mind only for the luxurious carriage, even tipping the "coachman" a bag of Mora. "A small token, here!" All along the way, cats crossed before the coach. "Step aside, make way!" whispered Perroux from beneath the mask, for he feared being late. "Sorry, but we're in a hurry too, we have a wedding to attend!" replied the cats. When there were finally no more cats crossing, they had already arrived at the Feline Firm. "Oh! Such rare and expensive silk... And the whole hall is covered in it..." gushed the Master, bursting with admiration. "The Ham and Vegetable Bake... tastes quite good, the chef must be the real deal too... And so many cats! I'm astonished. Lady von Frigga is so considerate. The must truly dote on her own exotic cat, just like I love my longhair!" The Master could simply not stop effusing praise. "Such a wonderful event, come, have a drink! And another!" The calico raised a cup of wine, urging the Master to drink more. "Then I'll have another!" The Master was in a great mood, and tipsy enough that he forgot to ask himself "Can cats even speak?" Vol. 6 Witnessed by all the cats and the Master, will the tabby cat and the long-furred cat get hitched without a hitch, becoming cat husband-and-wife... or...? The longhair cat entered, in step with the harp music. "Oho, you little rascal, the moment we stepped off the carriage you upped and vanished! Turns out you were off tidying up!" The Master was glowing with pride even as he rebuked his cat. The white satin trailing from the longhair was overflowing with flowers, pure white Cecilias like snow falling on a spring day. *Clap, clap* — The cats began to applaud in unison. "So beautiful..." Perroux put down his knife and fork without even realizing it. *Swoosh* *Woosh* The cats lifted the curtains. The tabby cat had put on a bowtie and top hat, and his whiskers and the fur upon his ears was neatly trimmed. He walked towards her with the solemn steps of a night, welcoming his bride. The full-sleeve cat behind him swiftly shook out the bag he had shouldered, and within were gifts for the cat couple. Colorful balls of thread, toy mice that squeaked when played with, and a finch-shaped balloon, as well as the long-prepared boat tickets to a cat shrine in a faraway nation... "WAIT!" A cold, harsh voice came from above, interrupting the cats' cheerful revelry. The Master had sobered up slightly, and stood up, swaying. He pointed his finger at the tabby. "This lout... Isn't he the stray always lying about on my windowsill? I know you, always leering inside, and always up to no good... "Didn't the invitation mention a precious, exotic cat? And where's Lady von Frigga? "These cat toys... Hey, aren't these from my house? When did you lot steal them? And all this silk and wine... All stolen too, I presume?" "Daddy, please, don't get angry..." The longhair cat quickly began to pout. "yes, Daddy, I'll take good care of..." The tabby said dismissively. Hearing "Daddy" twice like that infuriated the Master. "You shut your dirty mouth! "How could some random stray from Archon knows where with an impure bloodline possibly be worthy of marrying my longhair! "And you. You, the scoundrel calling himself the coachman of Lady von Frigga... "You're in cahoots with this gaggle of strays, helping them with their little scam, aren't you? Let me see just who's hiding under that mask..." The Master stalked towards Perroux, and was about to wrench the mask off his face. All the blood in Perroux's body seemed to drain, as though it had been siphoned by some powerful magnet. "Run, run!" A host of voices echoed in his ear, and his heart beat like drum, yet his legs were stiff and wouldn't move even a single step. "It's over, I'm done for!" Perroux covered his eyes in despair, but just as he did so he glimpsed something that seemed to be on his cheeks, something that seemed to be shaking, like trembling hairs. Ah! Snow-white whiskers had grown on his cheeks, but it was no old man's whiskers, but those of a cat. He twitched his ears, and found they were pointy and quick. He subconsciously arched his back, and let out a "Meeoow~" Just before he would have been caught by the Master, he agilely fled under the table. Vol. 7 "Run, Perroux, run!" — For the Perroux that had grown cat ears, these words alone remained ringing in his mind... "Run, run." Perroux was like a gust of wind in a black cloak. "Run, run." Following the spiral staircase upward, he ran towards the Feline Firm's exit. Just where did those magical cat boots go? Perroux knew not; all he did know was that he ran as swiftly as agilely as a cat, and he also saw the world from below like a cat. Where did the mysterious cat mask go? The answer gradually became clear to Perroux. The boots and mask had become a part of him, or rather, he had become a cat! As he had been wearing the coachman's white gloves, he was now a piebald cat! "Run, run..." Who was saying that? Perroux tilted his head, and the tabby with his bowtie and the longhair with white satin trailing her were beside him, running one behind the other. "Run, run... Monsieur Perroux, please, drive us to the port on that carriage!" Behind them, cats were jumping up and down, tearing off the decorative ribbons. The wine and salad upon the banquet table had been knocked over, and the entire mess had stopped the Master in his tracks. "My longhair, come back~" None heeded the Master's cries. With things being as they were, all he could do was take the tabby and the longhair to the port safely. Perroux simply couldn't deal with anything else, and besides, cats have small paws, so they can only handle one thing at a time. *Pitter-patter, plip plop* It began to rain outside, and lightning flashed. In the pitch-black night, there was but a brief moment of illumination before the rumble of thunder rolled in, and only that one small door was still open, without a single guard. They were probably hiding from the rain. Countless whirlpools swirled upon the surface of the lake upon which the ship was docked. If you didn't look too carefully, you might think it but a shadow of the bridge. But for Perroux, who now had the exceptional vision of a cat, it was immediately apparent. Holding the wedding gifts from the full-sleeve cat, the tabby grabbed the longhair and jumped from the carriage, swishing through the air and onto the boat in an instant. "It is all thanks to you! Monsieur Perroux..." The tabby gave a rare show of respect, genuinely bowing. "Now away, ere the Master catches up!" Go, go, go to that cat shrine. Go, go, live a life of joy. Moved by having accomplished something so great in secret, tears began to flow from Perroux's eyes. Though he still didn't know just how he was going to live as a cat. Vol. 8 "That said, it seems the Master has come into another springtime of love?" whispered the servants... But this was something that happened much later. Awakened by the blinding sunlight, Perroux opened his eyes and subconsciously began to rub them... His hands and feet were back! They were no longer furry cat's paws. What happened last night? He tried his best to remember. ...The piebald Perroux had turned the carriage around, and come back with a clickety-clack. The clock then had not yet chimed twelve times. Before the other carriages had returned, he had leaped off like any other cat might, and gone back inside the house without anyone noticing... So now...? Blast! If the sun was that high in the sky, he should've started his shift already! He bounced up from the bed, and put his uniform back on, becoming the bellboy Perroux once more. Yet the great door to the Master's manse was shut tight, and the hanging sign read "No visitors." "The cat's gone, and the Master is so distraught he's taken ill and collapsed..." "Such a beautiful cat! Even I liked it when I saw it. No wonder thieves set their sights on it." "Poor thing. Could anyone ever treat it as well as our Master?" So whispered the Master's servants in secret. Looks like the Master didn't need a bellboy on duty today! Perroux had gotten a rare day off, but he was still deeply worried. So where did he go? The Feline Firm. That night, and for many nights more, Perroux returned to where the trash-carting carriages stopped, and checked the shadows under every lamp, but never saw any dark entrance to a cellar. The boots and mask, too, were gone. It was just as though no magic had ever occurred and Perroux had never met any talking cats. Perhaps as the tabby cat boss had left, the Feline Firm had been made to disband... The illness plagued the Master for three months, until one summer morning, he suddenly recovered. The sound of the Master's humming emanated from his bedroom. It was a lively, happy song, the kind of song youths loved to sing when inviting a partner to dance. "Perroux, come here." The Master waved to him. *Ba-bum. Ba-bum.* Perroux's heart began to pound nervously once more. It couldn't be that...? "This suit of mine is already quite worn. Dispose of it, and purchase a new one for me! As for the style... something fashionable will do." The Master spoke kindly. "Oh..." Perroux relaxed, and walked out holding the old suit. "Though, isn't the Master the really old-fashioned, conservative type?" Perroux and the other servants were all thinking the same thing. A piece of paper fell from the pocket of the suit. After the tabby had left, the other cats had written a letter to the Master, masquerading as the longhair writing to report she was safe and sound: "Daddy, I'm fine. I've attached some dried fish and mouse jerky, please enjoy. Also, the Lady von Frigga who proposed is a real person, and she has feelings for you, Daddy. You should find someone too."

woven scroll from the People of the Springs telling of how Maawe the Saurian whelp created the hot spring. Different paragraphs of this seem to have been penned by poets of different eras. Legends tell that in a time long past, proud dragons roamed freely across the expanses of Natlan , a land they called their home. Back then, before the humans of this land had formed their tribes, dragons were both larger and haughtier than the Saurians of the present day. Just as humans do now, the dragons had different tribes of their own, each ruled by ancient matriarchs. Back then, there were no hot springs that bubbled up from the earth, no lakes that glittered as calmly and clearly as gemstones. Oh, and certainly none of those clamorous wandering bards or phlegmatic hot spring poets. Back then, among the dragons that roamed this vast land of crimson earth, there was a young one that was not like the others. In their pride, dragons have always looked down upon the other beings of this world, whether they were envoys of the heavens or puny mortal souls. Even the wars of old could not erase their sense of overweening dignity; on the contrary, it was through these very fires of tribulation that their tenacity and pride were forged. But this young dragon was different. It was fascinated by the songs of the Monetoo , and in secret was even given to observing human behavior. Its name was Maawe, which in an ancient, long-forgotten language, meant "bit of string." Young Maawe had not lived through the ancient wars and could not understand the "virtues" of dragonkind. As far as it was concerned, nothing was more pleasing than cool moonlit nights and the warm shadows of red cliffs. "Such blatant indolence! How can this be tolerated in the Dragonlord 's Palace? The puerile whelp must rediscover the ambition and fury of its noble heritage." Thus spake the dragon matriarch, decreeing that the young Maawe must leave the tribe to grow up like a "real dragon"— To harden its heart, to become as tenaciously proud as obsidian, and to be guided alone by cruel, lofty ambition... Vol. 2 A woven scroll from the People of the Springs telling of how Maawe the Saurian whelp created the hot spring. Different paragraphs of this seem to have been penned by poets of different eras. And thus, utterly alone, did Maawe step out into the boundless red wilderness. Just like a real dragon, it would endure the trials of scorching sun and desolation, Seeking out noble ambition and fury whilst cultivating a prideful, virtuous nature. In its wake followed the same Monetoo that had accompanied it through all those innocent dreams, And on a journey to find fury they set out together, perhaps not so lonely after all. Eastward Maawe trekked, towards the high mountains shrouded in sulfurous clouds. There it reached the canyons, there it stood before the pitch-black mines. Seeing its brethren seeking shiny crystals within the mountain, Maawe called out to greet them, But from that jet black cavern, the only response was the echo of Maawe's own voice. It turned out that these kinfolk had long since accustomed themselves to the still and silence around them, Now reduced to being creatures that lurked among the mountain rocks . Fury was not to be found among these rocks, so Maawe shrugged and left. Westward Maawe headed, to the long-dead forest of mirk and gloom. Passing the bones of its ancestors, it paid respect like a real dragon would. Before that grand palace woven from countless branches Maawe arrived. Seeing its brethren flying freely through the canopy, Maawe called out to greet them, But heard only the wind's rustling and swaying branches in return. It turned out that these kinfolk had long since accustomed themselves to the still and silence around them, Now reduced to being creatures that silently stalked the forest depths . Fury was not to be found by chasing Forest Boars , so Maawe shrugged and left. Southward Maawe rambled, to the brown prairies where rivers had dried up. Past the remnants of old dreams, those shattered aspirations of youth, And past the most ancient of cherished hopes, faded through age and degradation. Traversing a smoke-shrouded wasteland , Maawe stood before its brethren, Seeing that they had fallen into distant dreams among the fog, Maawe called out to greet them, And they responded warmly, inviting Maawe to join them in their wondrous dreaming. "Our brother, distinguished guest from afar — stay here, we implore you! Stay in our dreamland, and join us in creating past and present. Stay in our dreamland, and join us in dreaming of a wonderful tomorrow." The glorious past and future of dragonkind shone forth, lit up by the miraculous luster of their fantasy. But just as it was about to succumb to this enchantment, Maawe awoke to the sound of its companion's song. Fury was not to be found by dreaming, so Maawe shrugged and left. Northward Maawe wandered, to the untrodden edges of the land. Past the lavaflow delta, across the silent, blistering wilderness. Past the land where burning spirits danced, through the gate of stern black stone. Finally, Maawe and its companion arrived before the wise dragon, sat high upon its throne. "Young one, for what purpose have you come before me?" Thus mildly did the wise dragon address Maawe, marveling at what it saw. "I thought that my brethren's hearts had all been hardened by the war with the heavens , That the hatred that filled them had made them impervious to my advice. Yet today comes one before me, and such a young one at that. Tell me, what do you seek? Perhaps I might grant it as an exception." So Maawe told the wise dragon the whole story of its journey, Of the dreams it had once cherished, and cool moonlit nights, Of warm shadows of red cliffs, and the songs of the Monetoo, Of being exiled by the matriarch, and setting out in search of elusive fury. "Young one... A heart so artless, yet so audacious, You come before me seeking what I too cannot obtain. Leave this place. You shall not find the fury you seek here." Closing its obsidian gate, the wise dragon answered Maawe no more. Vol. 3 A woven scroll from the People of the Springs telling of how Maawe the Saurian whelp created the hot spring. Different paragraphs of this seem to have been penned by poets of different eras. So did the wise dragon's obsidian gate close for Maawe, and so disappointed, Maawe left. As they descended the mountain, the Monetoo — having accompanied Maawe all this way — began to lose its light and warmth, being far from phlogiston -rich lands as it was. It turned as pale as ash, and its song grew distant and faint. Despondent and begrieved, Maawe desperately sought a way to save its companion. But still the obsidian gate stayed firmly shut, the wise dragon undeigning to behold the youngling again. "...Scatter me in a pool of sulfur, bury me in the icy depths..." This was the voice that Maawe heard. Monetoo are unable to speak, but Maawe did not know this. And so, it decided to fulfill its companion's wish. After walking for untold hours, seeing through countless mirages, and surviving innumerable trials of deadly peril, Maawe arrived at a hot spring full of sulfurous pools. Uninhabitable for living beings, it was a place where even getting close might result in being burned by toxic gases and scorched by boiling acid. But miraculously, as Maawe scattered its companion's form into the sulfur, the boiling acid transformed into a clear spring before its very eyes. It was from this spring that the first poets of our tribe were born. As we Meztli say, "Poets and bards are born of sulfur" — for their words are scalding indeed. So did the young Maawe create Natlan's first hot spring. And so did Maawe make the hot spring its home. Its four limbs transformed into beautifully streamlined fins, its thin body became round, and thus it became the first of the Koholasaurs . Of course, Maawe did not forget its companion. How could it have forgotten the friend that had journeyed with it all that way? Maawe passed on all of the songs it had heard and learned to the humans born from the springs. That's right — to our ancestors. And to this day, the songs that we Meztli continue to pass down are echoes from that ancient era.

fable, passed down from generation to generation, in which the legendary Sage of the Stolen Flame is the main protagonist. Professional historians, it is said, have analyzed its contents and come to a consensus that this tale has nothing to do with historical fact. Here is chronicled the story of how that wisest sage in all of history, Waxaklahun Ubah Kan , the one known as the Sage of the Stolen Fire, and how the tribe living upon Hanan Pacha, which he built, rose up and then was scattered. Like many of the most ancient stories, it begins in the age when the stars and the moon held the sky, the dragons ruled the land, and Lord of the Night ruled the night realm . The people then were ignorant, and wandered the barren lands. The first Pyro Archon had not yet been born, and so none yet had Visions , could do naught but be controlled by the elements. Until Waxaklahun Ubah Kan brought back the kindling of phlogiston from the red and black land. Only then did humanity gain the power to vie with wild beasts and fell dragons. Now, astute listeners might already be wondering, as a human, how could the Sage Waxaklahun Ubah Kan steal the phlogiston kindling from the claws of the evil dragons? That is precisely the first story I am going to tell. Legends tell us that long, long ago, in the red and black lands, there lived a winged dragon. That dragon was the scion of the great lord of the volcano , Xiuhcoatl . In some versions of the story, it is said he was none other than Xiuhcoatl himself, but the gods only know what kind of storyteller would make such a mistake. After all, who could forget that the one who defeated Xiuhcoatl was the very first Pyro Archon, Xbalanque himself. How could things have been resolved at a point so early in the story? Anyway, when the great lord of the volcano fell into deep slumber, this vain winged dragon claimed the treasures that once belonged to the former, and proclaimed itself to be the lone king. Among those treasures, one of the most striking was known as " Pyrophosphorite ." That was a crystal refined of the primal fire in the depths of the great volcano, and its color was that of an ever-shifting rainbow, shining with dazzling light. Illuminated by this radiance, the winged dragon itself became bewitchingly brilliant. "Gaze upon me and see how beautiful I am! My light illuminates the world, and I am the sun of this land." So spake the winged dragon. But he was no sun, and his beauty was nothing but the reflection of the Pyrophosphorite's light. And in turn, that light did no more than illuminate the red and black lands in which it dwelt. Perhaps it was the vanity of the winged dragon that offended the Lord of the Night, for he&#32;&#91; sic &#93; sent the Sage Waxaklahun Ubah Kan to defeat him. But perhaps that seemed not enough to some, and so the gods sent the fool, Chaac , with him. Under the protection of the Lord of the Night, the two arrived in the red and black lands, and far away, they saw that radiant winged dragon. Waxaklahun Ubah Kan was in no hurry to rush onward, but rather made a blowdart from bamboo, and struck the winged dragon's eye with a single shot. Chaac watched with glee, and was about to charge up to capture the winged dragon, but was restrained by the Sage. "Foolish Chaac, though one eye is now blinded, he still possesses limitless power. With your human body, just how do you intend to contend with him?" The wise Waxaklahun Ubah Kan thought up a better plan. The wounded winged dragon returned to its cave to hide, and so the Sage Waxaklahun Ubah Kan and the fool Chaac disguised themselves as doctors and entered the cave. "My word! How glorious you are! How splendid and radiant! Ah, but what a shame that you cannot see yourself, and neither can the masses behold your beauty." Waxaklahun Ubah Kan praised him. "It's all because a few days ago, some despicable maggot shot and blinded my eye. That is why I can but hide in this cave." "Now that is truly serendipitous! We happen to be traveling doctors specializing in curing eye diseases. In my opinion, if you replace your eye with a bright gem, you will once more be able to see the light," said the Sage. "And not only that, but we can even replace your fangs and claws with gems, that you would surely shine a dozen times more brightly than you already do." Hearing these words, the conceited winged dragon could not help but fantasize about how beautiful it would be when it was twelve times more radiant. It happily agreed without stopping to think about it in any detail. And so the Sage and the fool Chaac took out the grainfruit they had earlier prepared, and one by one replaced the winged dragon's eyes, fangs, and claws with grainfruit. Ah, the poor winged dragon! Not only was his eye not healed, but by the time he realized he had been tricked, he couldn't even eat those two little humans! And so he died in a daze, and the Pyrophosphorite fell into the hands of Waxaklahun Ubah Kan. The fool, Chaac, thought they should offer the treasure to the Lord of the Night, but the wise Waxaklahun Ubah Kan had a different idea. He knew that the dragons that ruled the land possessed power far beyond that of humanity, but did not necessarily have more wisdom. And the secret to power lay within that Pyrophosphorite. And so he broke it open, and vast power poured forth. The Sage Waxaklahun Ubah Kan thus gained the power of dragons — that which is known as "Phlogiston." Vol. 2 A fable, passed down from generation to generation, in which the legendary Sage of the Stolen Flame is the main protagonist. Professional historians, it is said, have analyzed its contents and come to a consensus that this tale has nothing to do with historical fact. Next, I will tell you the story of how the Sage Waxaklahun Ubah Kan passed Phlogiston to the people of the tribes and built Hanan Pacha. After leaving the red and black lands, Waxaklahun Ubah Kan and the fool Chaac came to the land of forests and mountains, where human tribes lived. Waxaklahun Ubah Kan wished to pass on the power to use phlogiston to humans, but none wished to learn from him, for none knew just what use the phlogiston he spoke of was. "If we want to make fire, we need only strike the flint. As for the fuel, there's firewood and vegetation everywhere. What use have we for phlogiston?" "O shortsighted people, do you not know there will come a day when all plants and firewood are consumed and are no more? And that the most plentiful, inexhaustible thing in the world is rocks? If you can use phlogiston to burn rocks, then you will have solved the problem of obtaining energy once and for all." Thus spake the Sage, filled with confidence. "Haha, I'm afraid we will never see that day come." The people then could not yet see their ancestors in the Night Kingdom, and thus they naturally did not think of the future. And so Waxaklahun Ubah Kan had no choice but to give up. The fool Chaac, seeing the Sage troubled by this, suggested a solution that would make the benefits phlogiston could bring readily apparent to all. "So, like, we could take this big ol' rock and raise it up higher than the mountains, where everyone can see it. Then, like, everyone will totally get all curious and come running to us." Though they were the words of a fool, Waxaklahun Ubah Kan had little choice but to try. And so he first taught Chaac how to use phlogiston, and the two of them raised the land together. The land thus raised was none other than Hanan Pacha, the Upper Sanctum of which people today now speak. But unlike today, the Hanan Pacha of those days was still a vast tract of land, whole and complete. It floated above the clouds, and all the humans of Natlan could confirm its existence with a glance. And so, one by one, people from all corners were driven there by their curiosity. The kind-hearted Chaac stood guard by the lake, using the power of phlogiston to help the people ascend to Hanan Pacha. And those that ascended to Hanan Pacha learned the art of using phlogiston from the Sage Waxaklahun Ubah Kan. And under the leadership of Waxaklahun Ubah Kan, the people founded the first permanently settled tribe upon Hanan Pacha. Vol. 3 A fable, passed down from generation to generation, in which the legendary Sage of the Stolen Flame is the main protagonist. Professional historians, it is said, have analyzed its contents and come to a consensus that this tale has nothing to do with historical fact. Next, I will tell the story of how the people of Hanan Pacha broke the taboos and caused the Sage of the Stolen Flame to leave Natlan. After the people were taught how to use the power of phlogiston, they built a city on top of Hanan Pacha. Within the city were magnificent palaces and temples, all made of rare gems, brilliant feathers, and fragrant flowers. After completing all of this, Waxaklahun Ubah Kan decided to raise Hanan Pacha still higher. "For this, all of you must no longer eat anything produced by this land, save for water, for all the streams of this world flow from the Source of All Waters , and are not subject to the Lord of the Night's control." Chaac had no idea why they should go yet higher, and didn't want to leave Natlan. But whenever he went to ask Waxaklahun Ubah Kan this question, the latter would only speak of the "Lunar continent" and "Newark Holy Stone" and other stuff he couldn't understand. As Waxaklahun Ubah Kan was the smartest person in the world, everyone did as he said. And so they began to raise fish in the blue expanse and grow ball algae for food, and Hanan Pacha flew higher each day. Finally, the Lord of the Night realized the Sage's intentions. As they feared humanity's departure, they decided to try and stop his plans. One day, while the Sage was away, the Lord of the Night disguised himself&#32;&#91; sic &#93; as a human of the tribe, and, carrying a bottle of mysterious water, he found Chaac, waiting by the lake. "Friend, don't guard the water of this lake any longer. See? The water I hold is a hundred times sweeter than that of the lake. Come, have a taste." Though he thought of what the Sage had said, it was just water, so it should be fine. Or so Chaac thought, reaching out and taking a sip. Trying it, he discovered the taste was truly sweet beyond compare. And so the Lord of the Night gave him more sweet water, and he brought it up to Hanan Pacha, sharing it with all. But what Chaac did not know was that this sweet water was actually brewed from the grains grown from the land. In our modern parlance, it was alcohol. When the Sage returned, everyone was dead drunk. The Sage knew that they could no longer leave Natlan, and so he expelled them from Hanan Pacha. The scattered people brought phlogiston with them to every corner of Natlan. And so the Sage of the Stolen Flame set out on the road home. "The road home? Does that mean he went back to the red and black lands?" "Were you listening or not? The red and black lands were where the Sage stole phlogiston. Hrm, though the legends don't actually say just where the Sage's homeland was... So I suppose what 'the road home' means is that someday, he will return." "C'mon, that's obviously just one of those storyteller's lines you guys always use. How about you cut it with the suspense?" Anyway, after the Sage of the Stolen Flame left, Chaac accepted the guidance of the Lord of the Night, and established permanently settled tribes on the land. The age of the humans of Natlan began, but that is a story for another time.A woven scroll from the Flower-Feather Clan . It seems like it consists of what were originally two separate stories from different eras that were then merged together at some unknown time. As they walked along the winding path toward the storehouse, withered leaves falling around them like gentle rain, she quietly observed his profile, attempting to reconcile his features with the image she had of him in her memory. It had been years since they had last met, and he was not only taller now, but dressed in much finer clothes. The latter was hardly surprising — after all, he was now a Recording Officer of the Grand Alliance , and had come to receive the banner of the Flower-Feather Clan in the name of the Holy Sovereign . It was only natural that he would dress well for the occasion. He had changed, she thought, but how could a person not have? The only thing that had not was his sluggishness. "I assure you that the cook's skills will suit your taste," he said, pausing as though he expected a reply. She remained silent, so he continued, "Once we reach Cinder City and meet with His Majesty..." Unable to bear the ceaseless chatter any longer, the dragon let forth a thunderous roar, cutting it short. It could smell that repulsive scent on her, the kind that even all the springs of the south could not wash away. These lowly insects, it thought, puny bugs deluding themselves into believing that they could seize control of these scorching plains through the tricks of a traitorous lunatic . It chased her unrelentingly, intent on piercing her with its claws, smiting her even to the sand with them, though she had avoided out &#32;&#91; sic &#93; of its presence twice. She pretended not to care what he thought, responding only with a gentle smile. He studied her for a moment, hoping to read some subtle emotion upon her lips. As always, he found no trace of resistance on that mask of indifference she wore. Ever had she been so, he mused sympathetically. Since the day they first met, she had always been this way — quiet and compliant, never one to resist, as docile as a Capybara down by the riverbank, accepting without question all that fate had in store for her, the exact opposite of her hard-hearted mother . "Do not worry," he suddenly said. "Even if they are all gone, I will stay with you forever, until death parts us." She looked at him, smiled, and took his outstretched hand, seemingly submissive. "Until death parts us," she repeated his words softly, as if speaking to herself. For the briefest of moments, a crack seemed to appear in that perfect mask of hers, but he did not notice. In fact, he never noticed anything. Poor man, she thought, always so eager to play his role, yet never having been praised for it... What lousy luck. But luck was not the deciding factor, merely a footnote in this prolonged hunt. For years now, following the trail of its wicked scent, she had hunted this giant dragon. She understood its vanity and how it could be seduced with words, so certain of its mastery of fate that it was convinced it could resist the inevitable conclusion that awaited. It was this delusional fantasy that had drawn it here, just as her slender fingers now drew the bowstring taut. Perfectly still she remained, eyes fixed upon the approaching beast, its frame so gigantic that it almost filled the cave's entrance, as if it were oil seeping out from a jar. She could feel its gaze, its predatory stare. Standing there, she was nothing to it — as insignificant as a mere insect, a feather caught in the wind. "What is this place, you insidious weasel?" Vol. 2 A woven scroll from the Flower-Feather Clan. It seems like it consists of what were originally two separate stories from different eras that were then merged together at some unknown time. "This used to be my mother's favorite garden," she answered softly, her slender fingers gently caressing a flower, the name of which now escaped her. Her detached tone belied a hidden intensity, flammable as the oil she had buried beneath the warehouse. Purposefully she avoided his gaze, already knowing what he would say — those smug, tired metaphors, those irrelevant words of comfort, well-meaning yet utterly hollow. He would urge her not to grieve too much over what had already happened, trying to convince her to join him in dreaming of a future that would never come. Then, as had happened on countless nights before, he'd reach out and gently touch her cheek, just as she now caressed the flower. Yet she felt agitated, oppressed by the autumn evening's lingering heat and the insects' incessant chirping, so before he could speak, she snapped the flower's stem and turned to look at him. Seeing him surprised, she smiled, then carefully tucked the fiery flower into his gilded collar. "Come now, let us be off. I'm sure someone will take care of all this." The dragon hesitated, its eyelids narrowing like sheets of iron as it surveyed the stifling darkness. It had not fallen for her trap, not even for a moment. Yes, she had lured it here, into this narrow cave. But what of it? It looked down upon her with a scorn that was as terrible to behold as its own proud plumage. She was nothing like her mother , not like the archer by whose arrow had pierced its throat decades past, the woman who had driven it into the depths of the dark forest like an alpaca , who had deprived it of the simple pleasure of ravaging human villages — the woman who had earned its hate. No, this trembling whelp before it was nothing but her frail echo who could not hope to stand against its claws, much less her ghastly, fearful fate. Her very existence was a mockery of her bloodline , an insult to the ancient lineage of dragons . What absurd notion led her to lure it here? Such a childish stunt could lead only to her death. It was in this moment that the dragon caught the faintest whiff of a strange smell lingering upon the air. For a brief moment, its thoughts were troubled by a flicker of unease, yet this faded quickly beneath the weight of its arrogance. Pushing open the old wooden door, he caught the faintest whiff of a strange smell, like oil, or perhaps dry wood. He paid it no heed, simply taking her hand and leading her into the dim recesses of the warehouse. No matter what happened, he would guide her forward. Silently, he thought to himself that someday he would lead the entire Flower-Feather Clan the same way. Without thinking, he glanced up at the massive dragon skull suspended above them. He did not remember such a relic having been there before he'd left the Clan, but that was irrelevant. Lianca and her chosen successor were both now dead, and her soft-hearted second daughter lacked the strength to rule the tribe. Only he, who had accompanied that daughter since their youth and was deeply trusted by the Holy Sovereign, was worthy of leading these ignorant people toward the future that the Holy Sovereign had described. Elder Nyamgondho had no objections to this — he too was a child of the Flower-Feather Clan. After the wedding night was over, all opposition would be silenced. In that silence, a strange notion stole upon her, like a new and unfamiliar dream. She wondered, what if the young man she had once yearned for, the one who was once her companion, what if he had never left the Flower-Feather Clan, and what if he had not gone to serve the Holy Sovereign, but instead had stayed to witnessed her change, the growth of her defiance — would he have been pleasantly surprised or dejected? The beast's smoldering eyes locked onto her in the darkness, its pulse entwining with her breathing so that the two could no longer be distinguished. An almost imperceptible movement; and with that, a spark shot down the fuse, racing towards the oil barrels not far from where they were. Vol. 3 A woven scroll from the Flower-Feather Clan. It seems like it consists of what were originally two separate stories from different eras that were then merged together at some unknown time. As soon as they turned the corner, they saw that banner, the symbol of authority. Almost instinctively, he tightened his grip on her hand, a surge of searing excitement rushing through his veins. He did not notice the flame that slipped from between her fingers. Within a moment, a great conflagration began to roar up on all sides, engulfing the entire warehouse, the narrow space transforming instantly into a blazing crematorium. "Quick, that way!" he yelled out in panic, yanking her arm as he tried to find an escape route through a cascade of falling flames. Yet the intense heat began to blur his vision. "There's no way out," she murmured softly, allowing him to hold her arm without resistance, just as she always had. "I've sealed off all the exits." Knowing now that it could not escape, the dragon let out a furious roar, shaking the narrow cavern like a drawn-out roll of pealing thunder. She watched on as it struggled in vain, flapping its wings as if this might extinguish the blistering inferno. But it was too late, and the very desperation of the beast's resistance betrayed it. Containers of liquid phlogiston were shattered by its frantic movements, its flesh consumed by the fire that rained down. Thick black smoke began to rise, suffocating the few remaining dim slivers of light that crept through the crevices in the stone walls, as if it were trying to devour the faint sun of the autumn twilight. She struggled on in vain, choked by the black smoke that enveloped them. Crawling over to his side, she clumsily reached out to cradle his face and give him one final farewell kiss. "Not even death can part us," she whispered, attempting to raise a hand which had now lost all feeling. But still her hand fell; and with that, the long-taut bowstring let out a piercing twang, a joyful release of pent-up urgency. A feathered arrow shot through the chill of the autumn's evening air, careering towards the giant dragon that writhed in agony among the flames below. Through the searing tongues of fire, which at this point had nearly obscured the light of the dusk, she saw a group of people hurrying toward them. She smiled and looked up at the dragon's head, imagining the scene that would ensue when the flames were extinguished, picturing the expressions on the people's faces. Reinforcements from the Flower-Feather Clan, she thought — heroes who had once followed her mother into battle. Even with wings, this dragon she had hunted for so many years now had little hope of escape. And in the end, she thought to herself, there was indeed to be no escape. "Dead already," muttered Elder Nyamgondho. After wiping from his forehead the beads of sweat that glowed with the light of the burning oil, he pulled down a half-burned curtain from the beam above, then tossed it aside. Around him were the young men who had rushed over to help put out the fire, all at a loss as to how the tightly guarded warehouse could have suddenly gone up in flames. He sighed, then scanned the area again, searching without much hope for a clue to the blaze's origin. But just as before, aside from the two charred bodies, there was nothing to be seen except for the dragon skull that hung high above them — a relic of the beast that she, singlehandedly, had slain some years past. Everything in the warehouse had been burnt to ashes. Video Guides "Fires of Autumn Twilight" series locationA book about the local folklore and ballads of Chenyu Vale . It contains many far-fetched folk legends. Legend has it that in the depths of the mountains of Chenyu Vale, where the water lotuses and jade lilies thrive, when the rain falls and fog gathers in the dawn and dusk hours, looming shadows of the past will sometimes emerge. According to the village elders, those who dwelled in Mt. Lingmeng once worshipped many supernatural beings, walking alongside the spirit elders of fairies, birds, and beasts within the wild mountain. But in that earth-shaking chaotic war a thousand years before, those gods , fairies, and former inhabitants alike disappeared. Even so, the sentimental mountains retained the echoing memories in the Ley Lines , and thus they sometimes repeatedly reappear at dawn or at night, when fog and rain blanket the land. Sometimes, herb gatherers and jade artisans will lose their way in this fog and encounter these solitary shadows. As the village elders tell it, an encounter with the ancient fallen is often an ill-starred omen, a sign of unexpected disaster. The Ley Lines, having accumulated and accumulated until growing into tumors , bring forth these ancient regrets and miseries into the present world, and that is why there is fog and rain unceasing. And that is also why the mountain people avoid both like the plague, to avoid becoming entangled in spirit by those ancient sorrows. Even so, after Rex Lapis completed his great deed of pacifying the land and sea, surveyors from Liyue Harbor would blunder into the fog and rain, disturbing those dreams of old... But that is another tale. Vol. 2 A book about the local folklore and ballads of Chenyu Vale. It contains many far-fetched folk legends. In the days after Rex Lapis brought peace to mountain and forest, a mariner once entered the crisscrossed streams beneath the mountain and became lost in the damp dusk fog. On a bamboo raft, this person passed waterweeds that glowed a faint blue and purple, passed tree and bush bedecked in falling flowers, and followed azure avians never before seen even in dreams, before coming unto and into the cavern of slumber. Through the jade glow and the ghostly light of fungi, the mariner gazed with entranced eyes upon the inhabitants of old. A veritable parade of mountain ghosts they seemed — in ancient cotton robes they were garbed, and the hems of their clothes were adorned with jade as clear as light playing upon the water, and with nameless fragrant plants. Lined up and standing on the bank of a deep pool, they sang a song the mariner had never heard before: "How mine malice lurks lonesome in the dying light of day! How the hateful wind bears the rain, how the deep fog veils!" "None remain save a lone lord lamenting lost years — alas, alas! You came too late." Sad was the song and quiet, tinged with seeming resentment. The mariner looked closely at the faintly glowing figures in the cavern, and lo, one by one they removed their jades and threw them into the pitch-black pool, as if never having noticed the presence of a visitor at all. Descending despondency drove the mariner's paddle on the return journey to Qiaoying Village , but not before leaving markings along the path. It is said that Yuehai Pavilion would later send surveyors here to search for any mysterious settlements, and some also say that the Millelith once deployed troops into the deep mountains to search for any hideouts of illicit nature, but all without success. When Lan Jing, the famed doctor from Yilong Wharf , was yet a youth, he entered Mt. Lingmeng to explore the legendary, mysterious cavern in search of ancient prescriptions, but after his return, he would never again speak of the matter. It was only following his passing that his family found an inkstone within his personal effects. Legend has it that it was the color of clear waters and bright as the high heavens, and yet, with the doctor's death, the origins of this inkstone could no longer be verified. Much later, the descendants of this famous physician would go bankrupt due to poor management of their merchant shipping business, and thus was this inkstone lost amidst the morass of humanity, its whereabouts unknown thereafter. Vol. 3 A book about the local folklore and ballads of Chenyu Vale. It contains many far-fetched folk legends. Songs have long circulated in Chenyu Vale that tell of an ancient cave within which a demon lord from a past beyond reckoning once hid. They say that she wore a skirt of coagulated jade-blood, and leaned on the long-destroyed lunar chariot, submerged and slumbering beneath a black, bottomless pool of water. In these eons that memory has nigh forgotten, she was the mistress of Chenyu Vale, who ruled the birds and beasts and adepti of wild mountain nature, who controlled the ebb and flow of the Bishui River , who as an arbiter maintained the natural balance between mortals and animals. But those are tales from long ago, and though both folk indigenous and migrant tell tales of how she started a war out of incurable obsession, before ultimately being defeated, sealed, and plunged into deathly, dreaming slumber, the relevant historical details can now no longer be verified. The sole piece of evidence that supports this tale is this song of lamentation that Chenyu Vale locals once sang: "Though I wish to gift you herbs, who shall leave it at the sandbank amidst the waters?" "Where now fly the godly banners? The chariot is lost in the lightless bamboo wood." "How terrible the Xuanwen wail, who think upon the darkened pool." Do the proud descendants of the mountain folk yet remember and memorialize their lost god? The most vivid tales have been eroded by flowing time, now only faintly visible in song, like green jade only faintly discernable beneath the waters of a stream. So perhaps, just as a lost boatman once witnessed, one might still hear an ancient heart beating, its jade blood pumping, echoing in those boundless depths? Video Guides "Mt.

fantasy novel doing the rounds among the tribes of Natlan that is said to be translated from a popular work by the reputedly famous Fontainian author K'n-yan. The Natlanese who have visited the Court of Fontaine , however, claim to have been unable to find the original — nor has anyone managed to find a local who's ever heard of an author named "K'n-yan". It is the third millennium since the flame was stolen . Since records began, there has never been an age as enlightened and reasoned as this. Even on moonless nights, the countless towering monoliths of the metropolis are illuminated by innumerable lights. The metal pipes that connect the streets and districts shine with a resplendent glow, the golden liquid flowing within imbuing the city with a vital energy. That aureate fluid is "lithin," the lifeblood of human civilization. Since The Technocracy first discovered it 100 years ago, it has been the source of countless innovations, leading humanity into a new era. Automated tilling machines revolutionized farming, more than sextupling agricultural yields, while airborne shuttles soared into the sky, connecting the once-isolated cities dotting the continent. The people of today can no longer imagine a world without lithin. This applies doubly so for the rulers of the now interconnected cities. Lithin was first discovered in the ruins of the ancient settlement known as Natlantea , a city located deep within the earth, thus allowing for the mining of the substance, whose roots lie deeper still. As there was no way to drill so deep from the surface, lithin production was concentrated in the hands of those who controlled the Natlantean ruins — the Technocratic Assembly. As demand for lithin grew, conflicts arose between the cities over its supply and distribution. As disputes became ever more common — and increasingly bitter — the specter of war grew ever darker, enveloping the land. Though, at least for today, the residents of the metropolis have temporarily forgotten the shadow that hangs over them, as they crowd the streets and plazas for the "Continental Fair" being held in their city. This grand event, organized by the Technocratic Assembly, is a celebration of peace and progress, showcasing the latest inventions and fruits of technological innovation. Even though these inventions will likely soon contribute to the growing arms race between the disparate cities, they still serve as temporary comfort to an anxious populace. That is, except for you. You feel no interest in the novel playthings on show, or the crowds who gather to gawk at them. The hustle and bustle of the fair only heightens the unease you feel at the decision to meet here. A few weeks ago, a group of insurrectionists destroyed the lithin transfer hub in Tsath, before broadcasting a pre-recorded projection, repeating the same old cliches that "Lithin is a demonic gift" and that "The Technocracy are destroying the world." Apart from titling themselves as "Heralds of the Unenlightened," there was nothing to differentiate them from any other such malcontents. However, the ruler of Tsath declared that the insurrectionists had acted at the instigation of top figures within the metropolis, in hopes of provoking war between the two cities — even going so far as to provide evidence showing that each one was a metropolitan citizen. In order to clear their name and defuse the situation, the metropolitan authorities requested the Technocratic Assembly's intervention, and it is to this end that you are here pursuing an investigation. "My apologies, Mr. Detective, to have kept you waiting. This exhibition really is wonderful — it's been hard to tear myself away." Just as you are pondering the connection between these events, a short, rotund gentleman hails you from behind. It would appear that this is Akhra — the agent the Technocratic Assembly has sent to aid you in your investigation. "You can dispense with the formalities, Akhra. Let's start with what we each know." Vol. 2 A fantasy novel doing the rounds among the tribes of Natlan that is said to be translated from a popular work by the reputedly famous Fontainian author K'n-yan. The Natlanese who have visited the Court of Fontaine, however, claim to have been unable to find the original — nor has anyone managed to find a local who's ever heard of an author named "K'n-yan". If you hadn't seen it with your own eyes, you would never have believed that this prosperous metropolis yet harbored the remnants of such a benighted age. After days of investigation, you and Akhra finally locate the insurrectionists known as "The Unenlightened," hiding out in a decrepit church in the shadow of a hulking bridge. Their location leaves you more convinced than ever that this is merely a band of luddites left behind in the wake of progress, and not some insidious tool of a more sinister political plot. Regardless, you need evidence to present before the Technocratic Assembly, and so you and Akhra decide to wait for the insurrectionists to leave their base — on one of their seemingly endless missions to transport some unknown cargo — before sneaking inside to gather the proof you need. You stake out their hideout for a full three weeks before you finally seize your chance. By now you are sure that there are twelve of them coming and going from the church, and on this particular morning, they have all left together on their transport. Based on your observations, they are unlikely to return before dusk. Akhra stands sentry by the door, as you enter the church alone. The long and winding corridor is filled with a sickly scent reminiscent of formaldehyde. You grope about in the dark until you finally find the exit. Perhaps because it is lit by archaic oil lamps, the inside of the church appears much larger than expected. In the dim light, you can just about make out stacks of strange metal vats along the walls. It must be these that the group has been transporting away. You approach the vats carefully, noticing that each one has a label stuck to it, all of them displaying the single word: "Ignorance." "Perhaps this has something to do with some ancient religion," you think to yourself. Just as you are preparing to pick up one of the vats and take it with you to investigate, a pair of cold hands clamp down on your shoulders. "Darn it!" You and Akhra had diligently staked out the church for three weeks, and only twelve people had entered or exited in all the time you were watching. Either this one had never left... or there was another exit you didn't know about. In your panic, you kick open one of the metal vats. The stench of formaldehyde, the very same you detected while entering, is overpowering. The pungent smell helps clear your head a little and you finally see clearly the man who has accosted you from behind. His face could charitably be described as human, but where his eyes should be, there are only two empty sockets set amidst twisted features. "Did you see it? Did you see it?!" He screams, thrusting out his thick arms and grasping at the air around him. He is clearly blind — perhaps this is the reason you haven't seen him venture outside. Once you realize he can't see you, you quickly move back to the entrance of the room, and stumble out through the dark corridor outside. "Hey, detective, what's going on? Hey, careful! What are you running for?" Through your fear and confusion, you hear your companion's voice, followed by a flurry of hurried footsteps as he quickly rushes over to your side. Your mission has not gone smoothly, yet you still have something to show for it. At the very least, you managed to take one of those strange vats with you as you fled. With this realization in mind, you clamber to your feet. You look up to find a monstrosity gazing back at you, an apparition somewhere between a skeleton and a machine. Its face is sunken, a pair of lifeless, hollow eyes boring into you, and then a cold voice... "You saw it, didn't you, 'Unenlightened One'?" Vol. 3 A fantasy novel doing the rounds among the tribes of Natlan that is said to be translated from a popular work by the reputedly famous Fontainian author K'n-yan. The Natlanese who have visited the Court of Fontaine, however, claim to have been unable to find the original — nor has anyone managed to find a local who's ever heard of an author named "K'n-yan". A colossal head and slender limbs, connected by countless threads to a seemingly reptilian body. "What you are looking at is a 'Human.' It is the last specimen of its kind in the world." The monstrosity in front of you is gesturing to another creature, floating in a nearby cultivation tank. Even though you have become accustomed to your companion's visage, you do your best to look away. The sight of its "eyes" still sends shivers down your spine. "If this is a 'Human,' then what are we?" You ask the creature that, until recently, you had known as "Akhra." Now that you think about it, it seems obvious that this would merely be a codename used in the Technocratic Assembly. By means of some unfathomable technology, the church is connected to Natlantea. Perhaps every city has just such a place, somewhere to connect them in the dark. "You? If you mean those that dwell on the surface... Pugs, beagles, little gray men... We have had many names for them through the ages..." "But whatever you choose to call them, they are creatures we designed. Their biological functions are in perfect contrast to our own — the environment in which we thrive is deathly toxic to them, and vice versa. It is precisely because of this that the degradation they cause is vital to recreating a world suited to our existence." If things are really as this creature claims, the entire history of our civilization is the result of their planning, and the countless technological marvels and inventions that we now enjoy were bestowed on us by them. They have always been right here beside us, and yet we never saw them. In their words, this is because of a gland in our brains that secretes a gaseous substance called "the fog of reason," preventing us from perceiving the world as it truly is. The only reason I can perceive this creature's hideous form right now is that I inhaled the gas known as "Ignorance" — a substance that I myself had created in my previous incarnation. "I still have one more question: Having given us lithin, how can you guarantee that we'll destroy each other in a great war once it runs out?" "Lithin," the miraculous energy source discovered amongst the Natlantean ruins, is the energy-based form of these creatures. After their civilization had descended into a large-scale war that covered the planet in a hazardous substance, the surviving "Humans" decided to transfer their essence into pure energy and store themselves in a bio-vault deep underground. Following this, they designed a brand-new species, one that could survive on the polluted planet they had created. They hoped that this new species would aid in the biodegradation of the harmful substance until the surface was habitable again and they could begin anew. Yet that new world would have no place for their creations. Once the surface dwellers discovered lithin and used it to advance their civilization, the ancient beings from beneath the earth would start to re-emerge. And so they wait for the day when surface civilization destroys itself a catastrophe that will give them new life. "Perhaps you've heard of psychohistory? Or... probably not. It hardly matters. The point is, besides designing biological functions, the design of a species' history is also a simple matter of technology." "The incessantly questing heart, the barely controllable greed, the drive for victory... It all leads them to the same inevitable conclusion. 'The Unenlightened' deny it, but that is only because your senseless morals have yet to be overcome by evolution." At long last, you arrive at the final room in the deepest depths of the bio-vault, where the last memories of countless generations of The Unenlightened are stored. When the survivors of this ancient civilization decided to transfer their life force into lithin, there were those among them — though a minority — who resisted. They refused to abandon their individuality and merge into boundless, singular wisdom. Because of this, they were labeled "The Unenlightened." The majority were unable to deny them their rights, simply preserving for them this final room, allowing them to live out incarnation after incarnation among the lifeforms on the surface. Those who considered themselves enlightened believed that one day, their brethren would choose to join them and return to the embrace of the whole. Indeed, you are the leader of The Unenlightened. You have witnessed the countless memories of sages who established the codes of law, of poets who extolled the graces of virtue, and of warriors who fought against the oppression of tyrants. At the start of each memory, you see a huge figure cast its shadow over those who were exiled from the ancient city. The figure seems to speak, but you can no longer recall the words. All you remember is that you yearn for him. Perhaps every generation of The Unenlightened eventually returns here to give their answer. In that case, what will your answer be?A collection of Inazuman folk stories transcribed by a traveling writer from Fontaine. Its pages contain a wealth of myths and strange tales passed down orally by people all over Inazuma. The Mysterious Maiden of Genbou A long time ago, there lived an official named Takehiko. Refined and elegant, this young man trained himself assiduously in both the cultural and martial arts, garnering the respect of his peers. One day, while visiting the home of the illness-stricken Emon no Kami, "Chief of the Gate Guard," Takehiko chanced upon the Chief's only daughter, a young lady named Sayohime. In the prime of her youth, Sayohime was as graceful in manner as she was beautiful to gaze upon, her every smile and gesture flowing with innate elegance and natural grace. It was love at first sight for both, and so deeply were they enamored that they secretly pledged their lives to one another behind her father's back, planning to formally propose their marriage as soon as they came of age. The years slipped by, yet before long, rebels began to stir up trouble. Takehiko resolved to follow the Shogunate 's orders and join efforts to quell the rebellion. Upon hearing of his decision, Sayohime rushed to meet him. Tearfully, she said: "You will soon depart for the war, with no promise of when you may return. The battlefield is perilous, and I shall be cursed to wait alone. If you truly love me, then stay by my side, and grant me the honor of being your bride. I harbor no grand ambitions for glory, prestige, or wealth, and only wish to spend our lives together, happy, and in health." Afterwards, Sayohime recited a poem on the spot, which may be translated as such: How deep the suffering, how bitter it is to yearn. My sleeves are soaked through with anguished tears. Like autumn's morning dew, I will scatter as dust in the mirror for you. But Takehiko was unswayed by her plea. He replied: "Do not mourn our parting, beloved, it is but temporary. If I lived a thousand lives, for you I would keep my loyalty. We are born into the world in our proper time and age. How could I sit idly by and watch while a war is waged? I will return from battle with victory in my wake, then your hand in eternal union — our marriage — I will take." Having said this, Takehiko gifted to Sayohime a hand mirror of exquisite craftsmanship to be held by her during their wedding. He too bequeathed unto her a poem, which may be translated as such: Though my long quest may have no end in sight, neither does this oath to my future bride. Though the earth may see us a thousand miles apart, we share the same starlight that binds our loving hearts. And so they were separated; and so did months pass. A rumor spread of the defeat of the Shogunate's army, and how many soldiers had been grievously wounded or slain. The news devastated Sayohime, who took ill in her despair, and before long died of a broken heart. Takehiko returned from the war a hero, only to hear of his beloved's tragic passing. Wracked with uncontrollable grief, Takehiko made offerings to her with incense and fruits every single day. However, perhaps because she perished with such intense longing in her heart, burial proved insufficient to lay Sayohime to rest. Instead, she became corrupted by the Abyss , returned to the mortal realm as a demon, and visited Takehiko in the dead of night. Though she retained the youthful beauty of her corporeal visage, her new form had been stripped of vitality. All that remained of the tender hands that used to caress Takehiko's cheeks were bony appendages, darkened by death. Takehiko was a samurai, but the sight of this apparition sent him screaming in fear from his bed. He fled to the riverbank, begging a boatman to save his life by ferrying him across to the other side. By the time Sayohime caught up, no boats remained by the water's edge, so she leapt into the river, her legs turning into fishlike fins, and gave chase. After fleeing to Mt. Yougou , Takehiko, with magic learnt from the bake-danuki , hid himself inside a stone. There were as many stones scattered across Mt. Yougou as there were stars in the heavens. No matter how hard she tried, how could Sayohime possibly hope to find him? Just as she was at a loss, she dropped the hand mirror that Takehiko had gifted to her, all those months ago. It shattered on the ground, its shards all reflecting the stone that Takehiko had hidden himself within. Hugging the stone close, Sayohime wept bitterly as she expressed her undying love for Takehiko. She begged him to remember the oaths he had made to her, but Takehiko was still too frightened to reveal himself. At her wit's end, yet unwilling to be separated from her beloved once more, Sayohime turned herself into a raging ball of flame, consuming both herself and the concealed Takehiko, till they were naught but ashes. After finishing the tale, with great interest my friend asked me what I thought of it. "Speaking from our Fontanian perspective," I answered, "I find it doubtful that Takehiko truly loved Sayohime. The lovers we sing of in our operas are inseparable, even in death. If one should pass, loyalty would drive the other to join them. From Drest and Adsiltia's promise, to the duel in Tancrede et Chariclea, and even the farewell between Coppelius and Coppelia, this trope is a constant. If memory serves, we've an old fable that defines love like so: Even after all flesh, bone, and entrails have been sliced away, I still lie nestled with you in the marrow that remains. Takehiko promised a thousand lifetimes to Sayohime — even if she was corrupted by the Abyss, he should have joined her in eternal slumber. As a proud samurai of Inazuma , Takehiko should know the value of promises and oaths better than any of us." "Well, that's not wrong. In Inazuma, many people see Takehiko as a coward and a traitor to his beloved. However, it is not because he didn't return Sayohime's feelings. Rather, when faced with a demonic entity from the Abyss, Takehiko chose to run and hide inside a stone instead of offering her salvation. In the end, he was revealed by the very mirror he gave to her, and was burned to ashes. I suppose that's karma," my friend said while refilling her cup of tea. She continued, "It is said that this tale was originally inspired by a novel from Liyue . In that story, the protagonist never betrayed their lover, and the two were unable to meet for a long time because of the interference of evil-doers who transformed the girl into a monster and imprisoned her beneath a stone... Well, that's a bit distant from this version of the tale. What I'm more curious about is what'd you do if faced with similar circumstances. Suppose I was turned into a monster by the Abyss, and started haunting you, begging you to keep telling me stories..." "If your first instinct after being turned into an Abyssal monster was to come find me for storytime, that'd mean you were completely fine. After all, you're much more of a handful than Sayohime was in the story. Anyway, Miss Usa... I just so happen to have finished this cup of tea. Would you mind getting me a refill?" Vol. 2 A collection of Inazuman folk stories transcribed by a traveling writer from Fontaine. Its pages contain a wealth of myths and strange tales passed down orally by people all over Inazuma. The Yumekui-Baku A long, long time ago, there lived an elderly couple near Konda Village . Although they were poor and their lives were hard, they remained compassionate, and so earned the respect of their neighbors. One snowy day in winter, the old man of the house went into the mountains to gather firewood. He came across a plump little beast entangled in a hunting trap. No matter how much it struggled, it could not break free. It could only squeal in distress — a heart-wrenching sight, if ever there was one. "Poor thing!" the old man thought, his heart full of sympathy. "How unfortunate for such a young boar to be caught in a hunter's trap like this. So small, it wouldn't even make a good meal... What a waste of life. Let me lend you a hand!" So the old man put down his axe and helped the wild boar undo the ropes that had caught it by the trotters. The little boar squealed and ran several joyful laps around the old man, before running back into the forest. After collecting enough firewood and returning home, the old man told his wife about what had happened. She was pleased to hear it, and said: "Well done, dear! Once that wild boar grows up nice and fat, we'll catch it and have ourselves a feast!" That night, the elderly couple were just about to sleep when they heard a knocking at the door, along with the gentle, mellifluous voice of a young woman: "Excuse me! Is anyone home?" How could there be someone outside in a snowstorm as harsh as this? The old woman rushed to throw open the door, revealing a girl who looked to be around seventeen or eighteen years old, braving the wind and snow. Her beauty was striking — though dressed in humble garb, she had a natural radiance, not unlike an adeptus straight out of a Liyue fable. Seeing this, the old woman was overwhelmed with pity, and cried out: "Mercy me! Such snow, you must be freezing! Come inside, let's get you all warmed up. I don't know whose daughter you are, young lass, but what brings you here so late?" "I'm truly sorry to disturb you at such a late hour. My parents, unfortunately, have passed away. According to their will, I was to seek out a friend of my father's... But I didn't expect to run into weather like this, and I ended up getting lost in the snowstorm. If you two would be so kind as to let me stay the night... I don't mind sleeping in the corridor, or even in a storeroom." Hearing her story, the elderly couple took pity upon the poor girl, and let her stay in their house, giving her both food and a bed to sleep in. Perhaps because of this good deed, both the old man and woman were graced with beautiful dreams that night. In the days that followed, the snowstorm did not cease, and the elderly couple continued to let the young girl live with them. During this time, the girl tended to the couple's daily needs. Both diligent and considerate, she completed each task with meticulous attention to detail. The old man and woman were delighted. One day, the girl suddenly said to the elderly couple: "As I mentioned, before my parents passed away, they entrusted me to a friend of my father's. Yet though they are a family friend, I have never met them. I don't know what kind of person they are, or if they're willing to accept a burden like me into their life. You've taken such good care of me all this time, and I don't know how I could ever repay the favor. If you would not object, I would love to be taken in as your daughter. Although I'm just an ordinary girl, I'm willing to do my best, however little that may be, to look after the two of you from here on out." Hearing her words, the elderly couple were overjoyed. Having no children of their own, they had suddenly gained a daughter who was both intelligent and considerate. They could ask for no better blessing. From then on, the old man and woman treated the girl as if she were their own daughter, and she returned the favor in kind. Whether in front of others or in private with her new family, she was the very picture of filial piety. After some time, one morning, the girl offered the elderly couple a tray of irresistibly delicious-looking pastries, the likes of which they had never seen before. She said: "While you were sleeping, I made a little something, following a recipe passed down by my family. Please, take these pastries to the town and sell them in the market — I'm sure they'll be very popular." Just like the girl had said, the miracle pastries were a roaring success among the wealthy merchants of the town, and sold for a fittingly high price. From then on, every morning, the girl would make some pastries for the elderly couple to sell. With the profits rolling in, the family began to prosper. After this had happened several times, the elderly couple could not help but be curious. How could their daughter make such exquisite delicacies when all they had in their house was flour, and ordinary flour at that? Eventually, they could no longer contain their curiosity. That night, when the girl was making her pastries, they spied on her through a crack in the door. Yet their adopted daughter was nowhere to be seen; only a plump little beast, using its snubby nose to snatch floating dreams out of the air, then turning them into pastries. The elderly couple were shocked, and the little beast, sensing their presence, quickly reverted to the familiar form of their daughter. Throwing herself down at their feet, she cried: "I am terribly sorry to have frightened you, my dear benefactors! Since you have already seen my true form, I shall not keep my secret any longer. In truth, I am the baku that you rescued on the mountain, all those days past. In order to repay your kindness, I took on the appearance of a young girl and sought you out. I've been taking your nightmares and turning them into pastries, so that you may sell them for a good price." "Oh my!" cried the old man. "You're that wild boar from back then!" "Firstly, I am a baku — well, technically speaking, a 'mo' — from Liyue, not a wild boar. Secondly, since you now know my true form, if word of this spreads, my mistress — the one who oversees countless sweet dreams and nightmares — will surely not look kindly upon my recklessness. The two of you might also be implicated because of me. I am truly grateful for all the care you've shown me in the days I've been here, and I am sorry for having caused you such trouble. Even so, my wish to become your daughter was sincere... Though I am afraid such a request is likely impossible in this lifetime. So please, allow me to bid you farewell." "A baku, you say? A mo...? Nope, never heard of it. Ah, I don't care if you're a human or a wild boar, you're still our darling daughter!" "I am truly thankful for your kind words. But if others learn that there is a baku here, it might spell disaster in the near future. Also, I am a baku, not a wild boar." "Bah, what's that got to do with anything? If you don't tell anyone, nobody'll even know you're a... What was it again? Bakumo, right? Also, rearing wild boars is hardly something out of place around here!" "That does make sense, when you put it like that. But remember, I am a baku, not a wild boar." And just like that, the young baku stayed by the elderly couple's side. With their daughter's delicious pastries to sell, the old man and woman spent their twilight years in comfort and prosperity. And they all lived happily ever after.

woven scroll from the Masters of the Night-Wind. It is said that the stories within are older than the tribe itself, a claim that remains difficult to verify. The weavers of the Masters of the Night-Wind know every river of the night's domain — they know how stories and poems emerge from the black river of Mictlan. The predatory birds that fly by night are servants of She-With-The-Broken-Visage , who took from her master's hand moonlight condensed into three silver strands, and crossed the fog of night to arrive in the land of spirit-flame, commanding blind weavers to craft them into vivid tapestries. These hang in human dwellings, sanctuaries, and places of war, making stories and legends known to humanity, and as the tapestries continue to lengthen, they become history. But as the wandering sage banished by all tribes, Ropal the "Child of the Sea," once said: "I embrace chaos, yet I know not if chaos embraces me." Ancient stories and riddles always hide perilous secrets. Thus, the Lord of the Night blinded all who weave tales, compelling them to focus on stories while being unable to see the present, causing them to be pricked by the cold moonlight as with needles, yet never to witness the three moons ' death with their own eyes. Therefore, the great master of riddles and allegories remains forever an indiscernible, indescribable mist upon a tapestry. The tale the craftsmen wove next intertwined whispers from the Night-Lord's broken visage. Legends speak of a warrior named Coquitao , one of the Masters of the Night-Wind's precursors, whose soul's homeland lay beneath a distant midnight, under a frigid sun. Bearing the stone club Makana, he wandered the earth, following a contract forged with gods dead and cold, his life steeped in war and chaos. It is said that on a night of wind and rain, he made a wordless pact with the deity of the dog days, thereby mortgaging his fate to the Kame Twins from a plague-ridden land. The deity of the dog days bade Coquitao punish the deluded ones who had forgotten death, to bring down freezing smoke and dreams from the starry sky, and distribute them to the people. Thus, Coquitao used "Makana" to bring forth death irreversible, guiding the masterless souls back to the deep black river of Mictlan, returning them to the Night-Lord's slumber. Ever did Coquitao's fingers grip Makana as he trudged knee-deep in blood. Countless days and nights of struggle and slaughter at last pacified the madness that had torn through the starry skies. His companions followed behind him, one among them named Nagual , a cunning shapeshifter from a distant scorched land that burns endlessly even now. When the last fantasist was executed by Coquitao and his companions, when the river of blood at last pleased the jade-skirted master who dwelled above the thundering clouds, and who then called down sweet rains to cleanse all rivers, the deity of the dog days refused to return the hero's soul, instead commanding the treacherous Kame Twins to direct the despicable Nagual in secret. Thus steered, Nagual hewed Coquitao's head with an obsidian blade. And so, headless Coquitao failed to complete his covenant with the deity of the dog days, and could only blindly follow the Tzitzimimeh in their wandering. Vol. 2 A woven scroll from the Masters of the Night-Wind. It is said that the stories within are older than the tribe itself, a claim that remains difficult to verify. Seeing her chosen hero meet such a miserable fate, the mistress of heavenly stars was filled with grief and anger, and she instructed her Tzitzimimeh to descend to the earth. There they would guide Coquitao, who had lost his head, to his vengeance. During these long, dark ages, people witnessed Coquitao's headless body striding through moonlit nights, tightly gripping his stone club Makana. Some say he transformed into a black spirit leopard, silently passing through forests and plains, bringing nightmares and inspiration to priests deep in meditation. Thus did Coquitao wander through long nights uncounted, transforming into unnumbered forms, traversing lands awash with blood, winding through altars that once pleased the lord of the skies. But at last, he found the despicable traitor Nagual in the land of scorched and burning soil, even as the latter rested at an oasis, sipping a poisonous serpent's blood and hallucinogenic Mexicali juices. Then headless Coquitao raised Makana on high and struck, the blow shattering the traitor's skull like the illusory Mexicali oracle. Then fell another blow, and another, as headless Coquitao and Makana blasted Nagual back to his burning hometown... But though his vengeance was complete, Coquitao's spirit was already one with the life of the earth, never to return. Naught but eternal, burning, icy rage remained within that headless body, akin to the cold sun in the night skies over the land he called home. Long, long after, even after the deity who reigned over the dog days, the cunning twins, and the master with the jade skirt had all passed away, after the starlight-born Tzitzimimeh had begun to flicker, their light decaying, Coquitao's wrathful flame, the weavers claim, has not yet gone out. His headless figure still wanders the silvered plains at night, prowling the deep forests choked in shadow. And they say many heroes have inherited Makana in times of tumult and trouble, the legendary tyrant Och-Kan being one of them — he, too, ultimately met his end in raging fire... but that is another story.An ancient folk song from the People of the Springs. It describes the tale of the legendary hero, Rangi Nui. Rangi Nui's End is my hometown, And whenever I recall my ancestral lands, The morning sun shines over Rangi Nui, Looking out over Waiata, the spring of flowing song, Looking down upon Te Pahau, the wind-whiskered valley, Looking across Poheka, the land of abundance, Such are the lands of my grandparents, Such is Rangi Nui's End. I will journey to visit my ancestral home, On the twenty-fifth night, when the eels begin their dance, From Ohauiti shall I set forth, where the wind is gentle on the plains, To the waterfall where sharks do leap, to the shallow shoals, To Titiwha, those dazzling radiant depths, Where I shall climb the mountain bathed in sunlight, To visit the long-slumbering master of mountain and stream, To explore the ancient dwelling place of the long-forgotten pygmies, Before descending, descending into the valley's deepest depths, Down to Te Tahutama, where luminescent fish congregate, Down to Aka-aka, where plants grow small and strange. Down to Mahinini, where the dark currents flow soft yet sharp, Then down to dark Uropi, the depths of the forest... Wo-ho! Wo-ho! These distant, far-off lands, the hometown of my grandparents, They were thrown down, destroyed by disaster and violence, like collapsing mountains and raging wildfires... My ancestors once lived in prosperity and peace, yet were plunged into famine and exile, My heart cries out for them, I mourn their tragic fate, Like unquenchable flame roiling beneath spring waters, so profound a resentment, so deep a sorrow! Ever shall I wander along that never-ending wellspring of sighs, And I shall come to fields of mottled green xe2x80x94 that my ancestors called Kahotea. And like the ancient dragons, soar effortlessly to the mountains where chants abound... The lost envoys of the heavens built there a city of gold and stone, But it was destroyed when raging flame fell from the heavens, the fury of the ancient sovereign . Wo-ho! Wo-ho! And so I wander on, to Poheka, the land of abundance, There Rangi Nui once stood upright between heaven and earth, so the ancestors say, For he was both a sage who spoke to the heavens, and a hero of the land, Whose soul returned to the rising sun, whereupon the sky itself became Rangi Nui. Then, I shall head from the land of abundance to the distant shore, And on a shore overgrown with tendrils, conclude my final journey. I once climbed the lonely, desolate volcano , I have seen countless hot springs with my own eyes, And I shall head to the other side of the dark currents, To seek the ferryman , who rows a dugout canoe and wears a gold-feathered crown, And when at last I see that circlet, glimmering in gold, Then shall I again reunite with my kin in the garden of Hairinei, The birthplace of the forgotten sovereign of humans, And I shall gather my tribespeople and friends, and we shall go there together.

anthology of pulp fiction stories based on the exploits of Reed Miller that is wildly popular throughout Nod-Krai. Collated from various works and authors, the veracity of the stories within is as dubious as the quality of the paper they are printed on. Your Dime Eerie Mystery! The Master Thief Reed Miller and the Sampo Mill (Deluxe Quarterly Edition) (This inexpensive and entertaining story series, popular in Nasha Town, costs only 10 Mora per issue. Presumably, it's about the master thief Reed Miller's attempt to steal the Frostmoon relic, the Sampo Mill, from the governor's palace. However, in a seeming attempt to boost readership, the narrative is focusing on the many young women vying for Miller's affections instead.) ... Chapter IV Wagtail, a beauty as dangerous as a hunting falcon, has appeared! She approaches master thief Reed Miller under the moonlight... but to what end? "Leaving your lovely female companions behind to come enjoy the night view here? What a cad you are, my dear." That soft voice is as smooth as the finest silk from Liyue, and yet beneath its surface lurks a subtle cruelty, sharp as the thorns of a Sumeru Rose. Reed Miller does not turn around, for he knows that voice all too well. A graceful figure lands beside him with the poise of a cat. A young woman in her twenties, with long lavender hair cascading over her pale, bare shoulders and neck. She wears an elegant silver evening gown that clings to her curves like liquid moonlight. Still, it cannot conceal the mockery in her brownish-red eyes. Meet Wagtail — or "A," as she is known to a privileged few like Miller. She is the only femme fatale in Nod-Krai whose skill and infamy rival those of the most legendary thieves. Any treasure she sets her sights on is already hers; once the thrill is gone, she'll just as soon toss it to the poor in the streets as she might cast it into the sea. Countless men have vied for her affection, but she takes pleasure only in toying with their earnest feelings and has never returned the love of a suitor... The only treasure Wagtail has been unable to steal is the heart of master thief Reed Miller. This one impossible feat drives her obsession with the handsome, enigmatic man, and she's tried every trick and gambit imaginable to make his heart hers and hers alone. "I smell expensive perfume and cheap ambition, Wagtail." With a smile on her lips, she smoothly settles down beside the thief, then almost imperceptibly sidles closer to him. "It was a gift from another man. Jealous?" She lets a silk-gloved hand trail down his arm. "As for me, I smell overconfidence, Reed. You've got your eye on the Sampo Mill, I'm sure. But isn't that a little... obvious of you?" "You're right. I do want the Mill, which was stolen from the Frostmoon Scions, along with all the governor's other ill-gotten treasures." Miller finally meets Wagtail's gaze, sending an involuntary shiver running through her and a blush rising to her cheeks, which she forces down with a glib smile. "This is my stage tonight. You'd better find your own." "Nonsense." She leans in, her lips a mere breath from his. "This stage is big enough for two. The spotlight, however... That only shines on one. I'll have my hands on the Mill before you do, darling. And if you please me... I might even let you see it from afar." Ding! The words are barely out of Wagtail's mouth before she whips out a slender, sinister-looking dagger with lightning speed. She delights in the pointless and seemingly dangerous attack, knowing full well Miller will block it, and indeed he does, by simply raising his arm and deflecting her blade with his gauntlet. The clash of metal on metal lasts but a brief moment. "Reckless as always, Wagtail. It'll cost you one of these days." "Hah. Recklessness is a privilege afforded to beautiful women, don't you know? If it's not to your liking, darling, come teach me a lesson." Like a moonlit breeze, she takes two steps back and blows him a playful kiss. Then, she leaps into the darkness beneath the tower, leaving naught behind but the ghost of her expensive perfume in the cold night air. (The middle section of the volume has been ripped out, perhaps for a purpose other than reading...) Chapter XVII Just as the governor is fuming over the theft of the Sampo Mill, a group of detectives from Snezhnaya suddenly swarm in and clap him in irons! Just what is...? "Ha! Your Excellency, your fury must have overtaken you, such that you've forgotten who Reed Miller is. He is a despicable thief, yes, but is he not also a master of disguise, able to become any man, woman, or child with uncanny skill?" "Y—You... That's impossible! This is absurd... If you were pretending to be Leonov, the Oprichniki would surely have—" The man posing as Detective Leonov laughs, slowly circling the bound governor twice in a clear mockery of his pompous "deductions." "The Oprichniki? You mean the men who tied you up and sealed off this palace? Those are my people. I had them pose as Oprichniki, and your men believed it without question. Surprised, Governor? Have you forgotten how blindly Snezhnayan soldiers follow orders, whether from real superiors or clever impostors? As we speak, the Frostmoon Scions' treasure has been safely returned to their holy lady. Unless you plan to defy the Tsar's will and risk open war with the Frostmoon Scions, recovering the Sampo Mill is no longer an option for you." "You... You blasted crook! You accursed thief! I could have tolerated you stealing the Mill, but must you plunder my personal collection too!?" "Does it matter? Those treasures you claim as yours, those lands you call your own, weren't they stolen from the destitute who live here?" The man's demeanor remains perfectly composed, a stark contrast to the agitation written all over the governor's crimson face. "I see no difference between a bandit who robs the people and a governor who oppresses them. We defend our freedom in the only way we can, because no one else will fight for it. But rest assured, I'm not keeping any of this. Every treasure will be returned to its rightful owner. I shall not keep even a single piece." Across the room, Wagtail, posing as a detective, lets out a soft sigh inaudible to the governor. "Oh dear, this man truly is beyond help. He speaks of laying no claim to treasure, when he holds the Frost Moon's most prized gem in his hand..." Wagtail's words stun Shadow Weasel, momentarily pulling her attention away from her adoptive father, who is bound up in the center of the room. "Wh—When? Mr. Reed Miller should've given the Sampo Mill to that holy woman. Wait. He didn't secretly swap it for a fake while we weren't looking, did he...?" "Ah, you don't get it, do you? That's exactly how he deceived you young ladies." The woman sighs dramatically. "What he has stolen for himself is the heart of the Frost Moon's daughter." Vol. 2 An anthology of pulp fiction stories based on the exploits of Reed Miller that is wildly popular throughout Nod-Krai. Collated from various works and authors, the veracity of the stories within is as dubious as the quality of the paper they are printed on. Just who is this person who so swiftly captured the heart of a young lady who didn't believe in love? (This is a popular piece of fiction in Nod-Krai that chronicles the romance between the master thief Reed Miller and the governor's daughter, Leonita Prokhorovna Trubetskaya, from their first encounter on. Disclaimer: This story is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to real persons, places, or events is purely coincidental.) The young lady Leonita Prokhorovna Trubetskaya, the apple of the governor's eye, makes her way to the dining room with her maid in tow. Though there's a current of anxiety running beneath her calm facade, her steps are poised and graceful. After all, a lady must always appear as such, no matter what. Her eyes are fixed on the morning papers, for she's almost certain today is the day the master thief Reed Miller shall publish his notice. She might be beginning to understand the mind of this elusive raven, she thinks, and the fact that her father's men haven't even caught a glimpse of him yet has sparked a flash of anger in her. "Hmph, I'll catch you for sure!" Her father seems unusually absorbed in the paper today. Leonita swallows her bite of toast and asks casually, "My dear Father, any interesting news today?" "Mmm, nothing that my dear little Leonita needs to worry her pretty little head about." Lord Trubetskoy puts down the newspaper, smiles at his daughter, and says, "Send the jeweler in." A red-haired footman standing next to the governor immediately leads someone in. The latter bows deeply, a jewelry box in hand. The governor takes but a glance at it, then gestures for the box to be presented to his daughter. As a look of surprise flickers across Leonita's face, he says, "Come now, don't tell me you thought I forgot your birthday. At the ball three days from now, my dear little Nita will be the belle of Snezhnaya — no, of the whole of Teyvat. Now, put it on so I can take a look!" Leonita obediently takes the necklace from the box and clasps it around her neck. Her father's choice is, as always, impeccable: the design and cut are unmistakably from Fontaine, and the central gemstone is so brilliant as to outshine the finest stones from Natlan. "I know it's a bit early," he says, "but as your father, I should be the first to wish you a happy birthday, my dear!" He casts a glance at the necklace and adds, "Make sure you wear it to the ball. A very important guest will be there, and I want you to meet him." Her father is speaking in a serious tone, one that makes Leonita grasp the gift's true import immediately. She will be of age to be betrothed after this birthday. As the governor's daughter, she has always been expected to be married off to the son of some powerful Snezhnayan noble. This is why she has never believed in love. It was, after all, completely meaningless. Her father has special affection for her intelligence and beauty, of course. But more importantly, her obedience and maturity are everything he expects from an adopted daughter. Of course, that's just one of the reasons. "I understand, dear Father." He ruffles her hair with a final, affectionate gesture. The fatherly smile vanishes from his face as he returns to his formidable role as governor, his full attention now back on his duties. Leonita watches her father leave with a gentle pang in her heart. She composes herself after a soft exhale, for it's time to focus. She picks up the morning paper, and there on the front page, just as she expected, is a letter adorned with black feathers. It reads: Dear Lord Trubetskoy, Three nights from now, on the dark night of the new moon, your treasure will be mine. I thank you for your kind generosity. With the greatest regard, Reed Miller. ==================== "Tell me, can you tell which of us is which?" The jeweler from Fontaine stares in surprise as two red-haired footmen emerge from the dressing room. Of course, only one of them ranks as a Footman, Second Class from the governor's palace. "Left... no, wait. Right? No, that can't be it... I mean... right! Yes, the right one is right!" "Are you just taking a guess?" The man on the right seems a tad displeased. "Are you sure about that? If you're wrong, you'll be in trouble tonight!" the footman on the left teases. "Right is right!" A firm reply, but one betrayed by a copiously sweating face. The footman on the right bursts out laughing, then shoves his double toward the jeweler. "You're wrong," he says. "This one here is your sweetheart!" "Ha! Our disguise is impeccable!" "Uh... I—I meant the one on the right is the fake!" "You...!" "Hahaha, you two!" Reed Miller, disguised as a footman, interjects, his laughter filling the room. "Don't forget, our goal is to make the fake look real! If even a lover cannot recognize their beloved, tonight's operation is bound to go off without a hitch." "But is it wise for you to do this alone? If anything goes wrong, you won't have anyone to fall back on," the real footman points out, his voice filled with concern. "I won't lose any more of my Treasure Hoarders," Reed Miller says, the mirth gone from his face. "You've already completed the most dangerous task, which is to infiltrate the governor's palace. So don't worry about me and go back to Fontaine. The people there need the Treasure Hoarders' help, too." The footman and the jeweler exchange a glance. Then, they swear solemnly to Reed Miller: "We promise to steal all the misery from this world!" Miller watches the two leave, then turns toward the governor's palace, bathed in the setting sun. Trubetskoy had been successful against the Treasure Hoarders for one simple reason: his immense wealth. Even the world's greatest thieves have been powerless before his near-limitless resources. With enough treasure, one could hire the finest warriors, acquire the best weapons, and surround oneself with the shrewdest advisors. Wealth could even silence the law and bury all resistance beneath a grave of golden sand. The true extent of Trubetskoy's wealth has been a mystery to the world. More oddly, no one has ever seriously questioned its source either. A chuckle escapes Miller's lips at the thought. But now, he holds the answer: the legendary Sampo Mill, a magical relic said to generate endless riches, is hidden within the governor's palace itself. For this discovery, he has the red-haired footman's investigation, the jeweler's keen eye, and the governor's daughter (whose birthday was fast approaching) to thank... ==================== The newspaper with Miller's letter sells out almost instantly. In the days that follow, all of Nod-Krai is abuzz with anticipation for Leonita's birthday ball... albeit not for the governor's daughter herself, but for the inevitable clash between the master thief and the governor. The governor's palace has been put on high alert, with every arriving guest subjected to intense scrutiny. This is a necessary precaution given the master thief's known skill for disguise. As Leonita scans the long list of names and titles — barons, sons of earls, rising stars in the royal court, clans favored by the Tsar, and so on — the necklace around her neck begins to feel heavy, less like a gift and more like a set of shackles. Some fresh air out in the courtyard would be good right now, she thinks. "Mama, is that the daughter of Lord Trubetskoy?" "Indeed, she is." "But why is she... human? I mean, the Honorable Lord isn't." "She's just the Lord's adoptive daughter." "How utterly strange. Why would the noble Lord Trubetskoy adopt a human...?" A poised and elegant lady, whom Leonita has never seen before, is whispering to her child in a nearby hallway. When she notices Leonita looking, she turns away and leaves without a word. That's true. Why in the world would the noble Lord Trubetskoy adopt a human being? "That's true! Why in the world would the noble Lord Trubetskoy adopt a human being?" A whisper, speaking of the unhappiness creeping into her heart, startles Leonita. She looks around the courtyard, but she is alone. Is her imagination playing tricks on her? She sighs and turns toward the palace's innermost chambers for another round of treatment. These sessions leave her utterly drained, yet she endures them without a word of complaint, so determined is she never to be a source of shame for her father. For some reason, she recalls the voice she had just heard in the courtyard. It was a voice that, like a bonfire in winter, radiated heat that could melt the snow. ==================== As night falls, guests begin to arrive one after another. Leonita feels her nervousness grow. All evening, she is approached by a stream of potential partners, each asking for a dance. But as they come and go, not a single name registers in her mind. "Ten, nine, eight..." The countdown to midnight begins, and every eye in the room turns eagerly to her. Beside her father, the ambitious upstart from the royal court stands, his gaze fixed on her — or perhaps on the massive gem gleaming at her neck. "Six, five, four..." She can't tell what everyone is anticipating: is it her birthday, or is it something else entirely...? "...Three, two—" Huh...? Since moments ago, Leonita has noticed that everyone around her seems enveloped in a silvery-white glow, and this light has only grown brighter since. From time to time, her own body would emit the same silvery-white light. Her father calls it a disease that requires constant treatment — a flaw in her very being. "...ONE!" The jewel on her neck suddenly drops with a whoosh. The world is engulfed in a silvery-white light. Around Leonita, a silence as deep as a snowy night falls. She stands frozen, her pulse beating in rhythm with the light and her heart pulled by an invisible thread. There's a part of her that is screaming to run, but a gentle restraint holds her feet. What is this? Magic? Fate? Or is it the feeling she's never believed in, flaring to life the moment it comes near? The crowd around her melts away as time seems to stop, and from the stillness, a flash of warm red bolts toward her. "Miss Leonita, you're in danger! The governor has instructed me to protect you. Please, follow me." "But Father told me to... no. No, he didn't send you. You're... Reed Miller!" "Please, Miss. This was a last-minute order by—" "Everyone calls you clever, but in my opinion, you're nothing but a shameless liar!" "...Well, well. Isn't someone a sharp young Miss?" "Hmph. Father has set a tight net. You're not getting out of here." "But that 'tight net' is centered on the Sampo Mill in the secret chamber, isn't it?" "Ugh..." "I made it clear in the notice: Tonight, the governor's most prized treasure will be mine. And while the Mill is valuable, it's hardly what I'd call a true 'treasure.'" "You... A—Are you saying that your target is... me?!" "That's right, my clever and adorable young lady." "Hah! I am the daughter of Lord Prokhor Trubetskoy. I shall not give my father's archenemy the chance to take me hostage!" "Really? Are you really the governor's daughter? Then tell me, why would the noble Lord Trubetskoy adopt a human...?" "..." The silvery-white power, the treatments, the Sampo Mill, her father's endless wealth, and the word "adopted"... It all comes together for Leonita in an instant. She is the true source of her father's fortune. The "treatments" were not for healing. They were rituals, the key to making the Mill produce an endless stream of diamonds. Though a part of her has always known, she has never allowed herself to face the truth until now. "Ah, I almost forgot." As Miller speaks, he sheds his disguise as the red-haired footman, revealing his true face. "I triggered that little contrivance inside the gemstone at the very last moment. A good thing I didn't miss it." He leans in close and whispers into Leonita's ear, "Happy birthday!" And the rest is history, yes? Reed Miller makes off with every treasure in the governor's palace, and Leonita, having fallen in love with him the moment she saw his true face, forsakes her gilded cage to wander the world with the master thief. The legend of Reed Miller is often called fiction. But like a person who has never loved and thus insists love isn't real, those who find this story implausible only do so because they have never experienced such a moment themselves. Vol. 3 An anthology of pulp fiction stories based on the exploits of Reed Miller that is wildly popular throughout Nod-Krai. Collated from various works and authors, the veracity of the stories within is as dubious as the quality of the paper they are printed on. Little is known about Zima, who hailed from Snezhnaya, a land of perpetual winter. His name is found in no logbook, no epic, no heroic tale. Like a single snowflake, he briefly brushed against the surface of legend before disappearing without a trace. Zima came from a small town southeast of Snezhnograd, where villagers harvested ice beneath the snow-capped mountain peaks. On snowy nights, they called forth tales and skeins, like primeval airs sealed beneath the ice — of mischievous frost spirits who stole travelers' boots and pale, melancholy snow maidens who, when betrayed, froze the lovers they had once sought into lifelike statues by ripping the very warmth from them. Zima had seen a strange, deranged smile on a companion who fell for a maiden before, and he found it a monotonous way to die. He abhorred following a pattern, even the pattern of an unusual death. Instead, he longed for a unique fate and a life of adventure, and so he left the land of eternal white for the blue seas of the archipelago to the south. It was there that he first heard of the legendary master thief. The name Reed Miller was already well-known across Nod-Krai. Stories claimed he had been captured by the governor and taken to Snezhnograd for a hanging on the public square. But just as everyone believed his story would end with a swaying corpse, the governor's vault was found emptied with a taunting message etched in gold dust on the wall. No one knew how he had escaped the noose, but his miraculous return turned him into a tavern legend and an idol to the youth. So when the master thief reappears, buys a three-masted ship, and starts recruiting sailors seeking adventure and fortune at the harbor, Zima offers his name without a second thought. Life aboard the ship, however, turns out to be far less heroic than the legends promised. Though famed for robbing the rich, Miller runs his operation with the meticulous care of a spice merchant — his nautical charts are cluttered not only with markings for reefs and currents but also red-circled warnings for waters said to harbor sea monsters. He spends days skirting around those regions, avoiding the dark abysses where dangerous creatures lurk as well as the serpent-infested Sea of Mist. Day-to-day life has been a grind of scrubbing decks, patching sails, and scurvy gums. For Zima, it all feels too familiar, too safe, too dull. At night, he prays to the inky sea for a real storm, or for some monstrous kraken to rise from the depths. He longs to see the master thief drive a harpoon into a creature's eye, just like the heroes of old. More than anything, he craves an adventure that would truly stir his soul. His prayers are answered, albeit in a cruel and twisted way. Drifting into a calm, azure sea, the ship is met with a strange, inhuman song. Though it has no melody, its power ensnares even the most drunken sailors. The sails drop, and the ship stalls. From the water, a pale, hauntingly beautiful face emerges. It is a siren, and she demands a sacrifice in exchange for safe passage. The ship is given a choice: make a sacrifice, or be dragged to the depths. Reed Miller flatly refuses to make the sacrifice. Instead, he orders everyone aboard to plug their ears with beeswax to block out the siren's haunting song. But it is futile. Even reason and willpower bend beneath the weight of legend. Seized by panic and the deadly song, the sailors hurl the crates of Mora looted from the governor's palace overboard, thinking the gold might serve as payment. But the siren pays the shimmering discs that have scattered and sank into the azure deep no heed, for human wealth means nothing to her. Her covetous gaze remains only on the sailors themselves. The master thief, whose neck not even the hangman's noose could restrain, now has no choice but to acquiesce. Miller places his scimitar coldly at Zima's throat, but Zima does not resist. This is the moment he has traveled so far for. As the icy waters rise above his head, the face of his long-lost friend appears before him, frozen in sculpture, still wearing that faint, familiar, ecstatic smile sealed by the snow maiden's kiss. All his life, Zima has abhorred following a pattern, running from every known ending, only to realize in this final moment that every escape has been a flight into another mirror. His adventures did not pen a new story... They were merely unnoticed footnotes to an existing one.

don't think the world is monotonous. It's just that interesting things happen in far away galaxies. The great adventure of Vera, an ordinary girl always fascinated by distant lands, secretly begins. —Endless Days in Infinite Worlds— "There are times when I think to myself... There's nothing to do in this tiny village. What a dull place to live." This wasn't the first time that Vera had complained about her hometown, the small country village of Delphi. Her frown eased slightly as she lay on the hillside near the village, eyes closed, feeling the breeze of the early summer. "Then where in this world would you not consider dull?" Her buddy Sachi asked curiously. Vera sat up and leaned forward. "I believe on the other side of the Starry Sea is a planet inhabited by gods who can answer all prayers and wishes, and everyone bearing a wish is on a journey to get there. I believe, in our universe, there is a world currently in a war against doomsday, where the noble and elegant souls of fourteen Valkyries burn bright, if only for a brief but magnificent moment..." "You've been reading too many of those weird fantasy novels." "But... this village really IS dull. When was the last time anything fun happened here?" "Funny you should say that, a new family did move into our village recently..." "Novelty and fun aren't the same thing!" Despite what she had said, Vera decided to pay a visit to the newcomers. Sachi, however, remembered his family's rules, and walked back home for dinner. ... Vera gave the door to the newcomer's abode a gentle push. Much to her surprise, it wasn't locked. "Anybody home?" No sooner had the words left her mouth than the living room cupboard doors flew open and out jumped a black-haired boy wearing glasses. He was followed by a tentacled blue slime. "Make way! Tal, why did you let a stranger in?" The black-haired boy gently pushed Vera out of his way and picked up an axe by the door. "You leave me with no choice. Since you have seen everything, there is only one thing for it..." Thus began the biggest crisis of Vera's life. Vol. 2 Everything's just boring. Everything, all the time. It's not depression. It's just reaching the age of 14. So begins Vera's adventure. —My Backyard is Slightly Bigger than the Entire Universe— "All I can do now is ask you to help me." The black-haired boy, who called himself Ike, handed Vera a kitchen knife. He walked back to the cupboard and began slashing at the tentacles frantically. "Come and help me close this door! If a tentacle starts attacking you, use this kitchen knife to defend yourself!" Ike's glasses were now covered in blue slime. "Hurry! We can't let this evil demon cross into Delphi." Upon hearing his words, Vera helped Ike close the door. While they were pushing back the tentacles, Vera accidentally stabbed Ike twice in the back. Thankfully, Ike's healing spells were quite potent. "I shall explain everything to you. I am in fact over a thousand years old, and this door is a gateway to anywhere in the universe. That tentacled monster is an old one from the Large Magellanic Cloud — I went there to get something." Ike was covered in slime from head to foot by this point. He wiped his glasses with Vera's dress as he spoke. "Erm... is there anything else that you'd like to know?" "Who's Tal?" Vera didn't seem to mind. "An evil spirit that resided in the man-devouring castle. It has served me as a butler since I subdued it. Strangely, it behaved quite friendly towards you." Vera's parents always reminded her that people are destined to build families, and that it was futile to entertain dreams of anything beyond the homestead. Her buddy Sachi once told her that if a lively girl like her was to marry someone from a faraway land, the whole village would become unbearably lonely. (The real reason Sachi said this was that he was something of a weakling, and was sure to be ferociously bullied if he ended up having to play with the boys.) "The human spirit is still too immature. I need to guide you both through the wonders of your childhood." Ike extended his inviting arms to Vera. "You will sing every step of the way on your long journey to youth." From the Orion Arm to the Eternal Jahanam, from the Torrents of Time to the depths of the Starry Sea... "How far is 'beyond'? Any place in this universe is just as boring as my backyard," he said. "The scale of everything beyond follows the heart," Ike replied. "Thus, my heart is slightly bigger than the entire universe." Vol. 3 The Andromeda Empire stretches across half the galaxy group. Every planet within the Empire has its own demons and deities, dragons and monsters. "I've come up with a story for every star from your home." "That's not possible. Looking from here, the Andromeda Galaxy is only one fifth the size of your moon." So continues Vera's adventure. —The Man Who Stole the Lone Star— "I am the second rightful heir to the Andromeda Empire, and I have more than two hundred titles to my name. You shall call me the Princess Andro-Basilisks." The charming girl then crossed her arms, savoring the moment of her entrance in her mind and giggling to herself in amusement. Her sole reason for gracing Delphi with her presence was to marry Ike. "If you, he who conquered a quarter of the universe, marry me, my safety shall be guaranteed after my elder sister takes the throne." "If I may ask, how big is the Andromeda Empire?" Vera asked. "I reckon there are more than nine thousand inhabitable planets." ——With so many stars in your possession, why come to steal my brilliance? "So you aren't here to harm Vera?" Sachi cautiously asked Ike, who was carrying the scrolls and globes of other planets. "Of course not. I think she would make a great assistant." After putting everything down he clapped his hands. "You like her?" "Me? No, not at all, I don't like her at all!" Sachi looked away, worried that the old sage might discern his true feelings. He reached for a box full of photo frames. He grabbed a few at random, each picture depicting a different beauty. "Look at them... They all said that they gave me their one and only true love, but did they? In reality, I was just one of their many lovers." Sachi did not know when or where he had heard the saying, but it blurted out from his mouth in his moment of annoyance: "With so many stars in your possession, why come to steal my brilliance?" Vol. 4 There is a saying that goes as follows: Not all that glitters is gold, sometimes it is the outpouring of a broken heart. Either way, the stars in the sky certainly aren't made of gold, and most people's hearts aren't made of glass. In any case — here is the next chapter of Vera's adventure! —All that Glitters— "The people in these photographs are all so pretty," Vera exclaimed as she picked up Ike's box of framed photos. "Of course they are — otherwise, they wouldn't have had the chance to leave me with a photograph to remember them by." Ike has no intention of evading. After all, he was a galactic sage who was over a thousand years old. So of course he knew that girls were easily hurt, and that they could become trouble very easily. Ike would thus never cheat a girl — take notes, boys. "Having seen the starry host, I thus make star-shaped jewels to remember them by," he continued to explain. "But those stars that shine across the universe do not belong to anyone. So it is also impossible to steal them." Vera did not understand. "What are you saying?" "I'm saying this for the sake of a foolish fellow who isn't present right now. Pay it no mind, humans are just far too young." "I will serve as a go-between between you and Ike." Sachi said to the Princess of the Andromeda Empire in a loud voice. "Huh?" "I love Vera, I don't—" "Disgusting. Boring. Be silent, worm. You are an offense to my ears. I've already acknowledged Vera as my friend. I will not hand her over to a cowardly person like you..." "Wh—What..." Vol. 5 You can't have picnics on the sides of a galactic highway! Even the deities will be held fully responsible for road accidents that might occur! The doorway to a study in a simple village connects to anywhere in space and time! Having hide-and-seek across time... Vera's great adventure continues! —Roadside Picnic— When Ike was taking a nap, his servants waged a terrible war against each other. The great wizard had subdued many gods and demons to serve under him. As the most formidable wizard of his day, Ike was in command of gods and demons more numerous than the entries in a dictionary. But who was the strongest of those under his rule? The gods and demons decided to find out for themselves through battle. Unfortunately, they seemed to have erroneously regarded as their own three who were neither gods nor demons: the Princess, Sachi, and Vera. Ike only slept for two hours, but in that time three stars had already been destroyed! "Why should I protect you?" The Princess pulled her hand away, and the giant demon plummeted to the ground, its eyeballs gone. The dominant race of the Andromeda Empire may look lovely and sweet, but on their palms grow two special mouths, which they use to devour the eyeballs of their lovers and those they vanquish. "Are we not friends?" Vera wiped the blood off her face, and appeared to be hurt by the Princess' words. "Yea - yes," The Princess blushed and looked away. "I already regard you as my only friend for what has happened. I was not referring to you, Vera." "No!" Sachi yelled as the gnarly jaws of a dragon closed around him. "Do you surrender to me now?" The giant dragon jeered. "Surrender and concede that you are worthless, lowly rats, and I shall let you live!" "I surrender! I surrender! Let me go!" Sachi screamed. "Why, a lizard of your despicable breed should know better than to utter such foolish words! Even the geckos in my palace could crush you." The Princess gave her wrists a twirl. "No! This has nothing to do with me!" Sachi yelled as the dragon cast him into the sky. And just like that, the battle between the dominant species of Andromeda and the ancient giant dragon was over. The moral? You won't get hurt if you just surrender. Sachi was knocked out of the contest and woke Ike up with the slap of a slipper. Vera also survived thanks to the protection of the Princess. "Argh! You imbecile! The mere sight of you is revolting. Do not come near me! Don't talk to me, don't look at me, nor breathe the same air as me, you lowly scum!" The Princess could not have a lower opinion of Sachi. Vol. 6 There was once a great scholar who wished to write a book about all the festive days of the empire. After looking into it more closely, he discovered that every single day had some sort of a festival associated with it... He persevered with this monumental writing task for six months before giving up on it. But don't worry — as far as this book is concerned, I am the author, and I won't let my readers down! —For Every Season— Though those things had indeed happened, they were occurrences on a galactic scale. Now, something more mundane was about to happen. The date of the town festival was drawing near. "I suppose it's finally my turn to introduce you two to this small town, then?" Vera said as she served the Princess and Ike her very own braised dishes. After all, those things they had encountered in their galactic escapades had to be explained by the Princess and Ike. If there was any knowledge Vera had to present to them, it was the knowledge of her hometown. "...Afterward, the great king's first messenger, the brave knight Huffman strode west across two continents, crossing great oceans and rivers. As for the imperial sage, the witch from the east, she passed by her hometown on her road eastward, and then came by the land of the Nether. Thus, they finally met here." "Huh, is that so. How interesting." Though she was trying hard not to let Vera notice that she did not in fact care for the story at all, the Princess' acting skills required some work. "So that can only mean that this place is on the polar opposite side of this world from the great king's capital, right?" Ike said, commenting on a seemingly unimportant aspect of the tale. "Ahahaha, that's true if you think about it." Vera rubbed the back of her head with a crooked smile. "I've always said that I want to leave this place, but in the end, I discovered that this is the place I'm most familiar with." Having come to this realization on the eve of the town's anniversary, Vera began crying right in front of Sachi's eyes. "You numbskull! You made Vera cry!" The Princess made her entry with a flying kick, sending Sachi hurtling away. Vol. 7 In the star clusters at the outer reaches of the universe, habitable planets are few and far between. For this reason, the region is the playground of space captains and pirates alone. With this being the universe, though, there is no port and starboard in the traditional sense — out here, "starboard" means whichever side of your spacecraft is oriented towards the star you are using for navigation... Lose yourself, and especially your sense of direction, in this next chapter of Vera's starbound voyage! —Galaxy Wars— "Re-igniting a sun is not difficult, but I don't think the Andromeda Empire would like to see that happen," Ike said to the panicked Vera. "Do you mean that the Princess has kidnapped Sachi?" Vera said with some shock in her voice after giving the matter some thought. "How did you come to that conclusion? I'm saying that only the Andromeda Empire would be capable of kidnapping you and the Princess." Ike then turned to face the innumerable lives that dwelled within the galaxy. He paused for a moment before declaring thus: "Inhabitants of the galaxy. Though I have come here upon the invitation of the High Saint King Lebannin to re-ignite the flames of the few remaining stars, it seems the Andromeda Empire does not wish for your longevity, and has thus kidnapped my friend." "Are you then to put their lives over that of all life?" Saint King Lebannin arose from her seat. "If that is the case, why then do I rule over these stars?" Finally, the Saint King would charge into peril alone, defeat the assassins from the Andromeda Empire, and rescue both the Princess and Sachi. Afterward, she had a few words with Ike. "I didn't think you could defeat the dominant species of Andromeda," Ike praised. "They're a strong and hardy race. I suppose it's true, the, that you defeated the holy dragon en route to becoming the Saint King." "I am, in fact, that same holy dragon. I fused with Lebannin's flesh and blood, and now act according to her wishes." "Huh..." Ike was a little shocked by this. "Ah, yes. Is that the fellow the person the Second Princess is fond of? When I barged in, they were..." "What!?" Now that was a much bigger shock for Ike. Vol. 8 Of course boys aren't invited to the girl's slumber party! Girls are sacrosanct, like the gods of the golden age. Vera, the Princess, Saint King Lebannin, and Ur, alpha female of the Galactic Swarm, shall talk deep into the night! —The Girls Themselves— "I said it was a misunderstanding! She was about to eat me." Sachi explained. "I don't think she was intending to eat you," Ike said, pushing his glasses up. "The dominant race of the Andromeda Empire have organs on the palms of their hands that allow them to capture and consume eyeballs." "I've seen it before. Looks like some sort of... lamprey?" Sachi shivered a little as he said that last word. "Let me finish." Ike wanted to touch his eyes, but wound up pressing his fingerprint into his glasses. Taking his glasses off, he touched his left eye. "Their practice of eating eyes has two meanings: submission..." He touched his right eye. "...and love." Sachi also began to rub both his eyes, thinking about which it was back then. "Whatever the case, I don't think the princess really understands the difference. Those who submit to her, those things she conquers, those who love her — they're all the same to her. People who can't hurt her in an imperial succession battle." "Huh. No wonder those Andromeda Empire assassins kidnapped her. Two birds with one stone, eh?" "I'm not getting involved in their succession wars. I can only help you support her better." "Hey now — we're not like that! I mean, doesn't she hate me the most?" And what were the girls talking about at this very moment? That may yet be an eternal mystery. Vol. 9 "Vera's so beautiful, like a shining star in the universe, but I..." "Boys at this age are always more petite than girls of a similar age." Childhood must be let go of to welcome the coming of the adolescent years. It's not too late to think about it now... Real melancholy finally hits Vera. —Death Awaits in Abyssal Waves— As Vera and Sachi grew up, the chemistry between the four changed in subtle and inexplicable ways. "Enough with excuses," Sachi said to Ike. "Vera will not cease pursuing you even if you never reciprocate her feelings." Ike was a symbol of a faraway land. He stood for the unknown, for that which was waiting to be discovered. A brave bird would never nest there, but would be forever adrift in the winds of admiration. Ike retorted, "No matter which way you look at it, being a thousand years old makes you an elderly person." "Then we are well-matched in age." The Princess merrily chipped in on their conversation. When Sachi finally mustered the courage to declare his love, he met with the most dreadful fate. Remember the ancient sword that Ike and Vera received from the old ones when they first met? It was what Ike needed to propel destiny forward! But now, Vera had her finger slit by its blade, and a malicious ancient virus sapped the life out of her. "This is all your fault!" Sachi grabbed Ike by the collar. If the tragedy had not happened, Ike would have laughed it off, for he was a gentle soul. But this time, he slapped Sachi's hand away. "Don't you know how to rewind time? Please Do it to save Vera!" Even the Princess begged. "You don't understand. Only the future can save the past, not the other way around." Ike bit his lip until blood came flowing down. "A local myth speaks of a Silver Age when people enjoyed a seemingly endless childhood that could last up to two hundred years. This only made their short maturity a pain to bear." To the others, childhood was long gone, but youth was forever beyond their reach. To be continued in "Vera's Melancholy" without Vera. Vol. 10 "It's enough. Let's go home... The furthest place I've dreamt of, is the Delphi where you are." Though the explanation is delayed, you should know that Delphi is the center of Greek mythology. Vera's Melancholy - the perfect ending... or is it? —Vera's Melancholy— To revive Vera, Sachi, Ike and the Princess embarked on a spectacular and thrilling journey that lasted twenty years. From battling Signor Inferno to slaying the Star Devourer, the trio had even rescued two galaxies and the Galaxy Empire, and eliminated four species of ruthless interstellar worms along the way. When Vera opened her eyes, she found herself in the arms of Sachi, now a hero of cosmic proportions. To the dominant species of Andromeda, twenty years was nothing more than a few seconds. The Princess looked lovely as always, but her countenance was a curious mix of genuine happiness and loss. Sachi, having lost an eye in his adventures, was now a tall and strapping young man. His flowing tears soaked into Vera's shoulders — though still prone to tears, he was no longer his feeble-minded self. The years had been kind to Ike, who after all this time still had that same old smile on his face. "I am but an echo of time," Ike said as he began his preparations. "As I've said, the past cannot change the future, for the predetermined rules of equilibrium are slightly more powerful than me. But the future, with its infinite possibilities, could save the world." Ike transformed Sachi back into what he was twenty years ago, and time reversed itself to the day of their departure. Everything seemed to remain unchanged between the four, though they realized that the innocence they once shared was one thing that could never return. "I am sorry for depriving you of your childhood," Ike said to him. "Now go, the youth that you deserve awaits." "I have witnessed every wonder in the universe for your sake, and this was how my childhood ended." Sachi summoned every last ounce of his courage as he stood before the girl of his destiny. "I will never reach my youth without you by my side." What will her answer be? Editor's note: The author of "Vera's Melancholy" is now off living the high life with the royalties from the first nine volumes. If you happen to see him in your corner of the universe, please help us to impress upon him the urgency with which we require the next volume."Dandelion, Dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land," the Fox chants. An unforgettable Mondstadt fairytale about a hunter and a fox. The Fox in the Dandelion Sea, an 11-part story, begins here. "Dandelion, dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land." The little fox chanted. He blew the dandelion flower and sent the seeds flying. He then spoke in a more serious tone. "May my teacher's wishes ride the wind and reach the Anemo Archon ." A wind blew past us and swept away the dandelion seeds. Did they fly to a better place, carrying my hopes and dreams there with them? When did this happen? Some time ago, behind the village, there grew a forest of countless lush trees. At the center of this forest was a small lake. The lake was like the stained glass windows of Mondstadt Cathedral : crystal clear and shimmering in the sunlight. The sun shone through the treetops and glistened on the water's surface like fragments of gemstone. It was really something. The weather was cool that day. I was hunting in the forest when I arrived at the lake's edge. The shimmering water somehow reminded me of a girl I loved a long time ago. I couldn't remember much about her, but felt that her eyes must have looked like the lake, glittering as if harboring fragments of gemstone within. I became lost in thought as I stared at the glistening water. Walking transfixed along the lakeside, I had forgotten entirely that I was out for a hunt. I came to when I heard the sound of something freezing up. It was a Mist Flower growing by the lake, having just frozen the water around it. Next to it was a white fox, its tail frozen in the ice. Poor critter. "It must have had its tail in the water by the Mist Flower while it was drinking." Mist Flowers are dangerous plants and can cause frostbite if handled without care. Extreme caution must be taken when handling them. As it saw me approach, the fox struggled in fear, but its still-frozen tail kept it rooted to the spot. The fox whimpered in pain. "Oh no, this won't do." I thought to myself. "Poor critter. It's gonna die anyway if I don't save it, may as well end its pain by bringing it home as my game for the day." I imagined what a delicious fox stew I could cook with the carrots I grew. Just thinking about it gave me energy and brought a smile to my face. So I took out my hunting bow and slowly walked toward it. "Be good and stay put." Vol. 2 "Be good and stay put." Trapped by a Mist Flower, what does fate have in store by the fox who met a hunter? The story of the Hunter and the Fox continues in Part 2. "Be good and stay put." That's what my father's father had taught me. When I went fox hunting, I always chanted his words silently, so that my hands wouldn't shake when pulling the bowstring. But just as I was about to release the arrow, the fox lifted its head and looked me straight in the eye. It had eyes like the lake, glistening as if harboring fragments of gemstone within. My head began spinning, as if a strong wind were blowing inside it. My arrow missed its target and instead smashed the ice, releasing the fox's tail. The fox raised its tail and looked at me once more before running off into the forest. I came to my senses and began the chase — but who in this world can run faster than a fox? Gradually, the fox began to shrink into the distance, eventually turning into a white spot. "Hey! Don't go!" I shouted, barely catching my breath. After hearing my words, the spot seemed to slow. "Is it waiting for me?" I pondered. "If running for its life, a fox is able to shake off anyone in no time." Foxes are strange animals. Even when running on a flat plain like at Windrise , where one can see clearly for miles ahead, they somehow still seem to disappear from view. It's almost as if they run into another world. This led me to my conclusion: "The fox must be waiting for me!" Convinced of this fact, I chased the glittering white spot for hours on end. Suddenly, a chilling wind began to blow. I stood there, shivering, and what I saw next astounded me. "How can this be?" Suddenly, instead of one, there were now two white spots. More appeared. Three, four, five... They seemed to grow in number as the winds blew. Eventually I lost track. Suddenly, with a stinging sensation, one of them flew directly into my eye. Upon inspection, I discovered that the spots were in fact nothing more than dandelion seeds floating in the wind. The fox had disappeared. I laughed at my own foolishness and went home. For supper, I had carrot fox stew — though without fox, or any other meat for that matter. The gods know how much I hate boiled carrots without meat! I felt starving, and in time fell asleep. I awoke in the middle of the night to something stirring outside my door. Vol. 3 The Hunter of fruitless hunts was awoken by a commotion outside. Who is at the door? The story of the Hunter and the Fox continues. The Fox in the Dandelion Sea, Part 3. Having failed to catch the fox, I went to sleep with only tasteless boiled carrots in my stomach. If not for what happened next, I would have forgotten about the fox by now. I awoke with a start to strange noises coming from outside my door. "Perhaps boars have come to eat my carrots?" I hopped out of bed and opened my door. To my surprise, there stood a tiny little white fox. Its fur was so white that it glowed in the dark, not unlike the way sunlight sparkles on water after filtering through the treetops. "This must be the same fox from earlier!" I thought again of those eyes that looked like gemstones in the water, gazing at me as if from the depths of my heart. And so I walked over to the fox, unarmed and with tired eyes. This time it stayed still and waited for me in silence. The closer I drew, the greater in stature it became. By the time I stood before it, it had magically transformed into a human. She was a tall and slender woman, with a swan-like neck and pearly skin. Her eyes sparkled like gemstone fragments in pools of water — in the darkness they seemed to shine like rays of sunlight on water after filtering through the treetops. "What a beauty. She looks a lot like the girl I fell in love with long ago, though I barely remember her name. Those eyes tell me she must be her." I thought to myself. "This can't be. Must be some type of fox magic." Stranger still, the idea of "fox magic" had only occurred to me in that instant. You'd believe anything after you'd seen those eyes. For all the magic and transformation I had witnessed, nothing amazed me quite as much as the gemstone lakes of her eyes. For a while, we stood silently in the dead of night. And at last she spoke. Though not in our common tongue, I could somehow understand her. Some other magic, perhaps. "I would have died by that lake, if you had not come in my hour of need." She paused and continued: "Although to die by that gemstone lake is no bad thing," "We foxes are grateful beings, so you must let me return the favor." She bowed to me, her long silky black hair flowing down her shoulders like streams. Vol. 4 After a few days apart, a long-awaited reunion takes place on a midsummer's night amidst a veritable blizzard of dandelion seeds. At the direction of the fox, an ocean of dandelions opens up before the hunter's very eyes... For the next few days after that night, the fox never came again. But in those few days, prey in the forest became gradually more abundant. Everything from small finches, long-legged cranes, and even scurrying boars... Maybe it was the change in season, or some sort of repayment from the fox. Whatever the case, the following days brought real stew to the table. But the fox never came again. As strange as it may seem, it had honestly been easier to sleep hungry. Even with a full, satisfied stomach, I couldn't help but think about the day we met, and the woman that the fox had turned into... When would I gaze upon her eyes again, glittering... like water in a lake. Lying half-asleep with a heart full of turmoil, I heard a faint sound outside my door. I hopped from the bed and swung the door open, eager to see a small white silhouette awaiting me. But there were no lake-blue eyes, and there was no fluffy white foxtail. Instead, all I could see were dandelion seeds drifting in the white moonlight, floating like snowflakes in the air. Suddenly, something got caught in my nostrils. "Ah-Ahchooo!!!" Immediately, the fluffy white dandelion seeds began to swirl, filling the sky like a snowstorm. Amidst the flurry of dandelion seeds, a pair of jewel-like eyes were looking at me, staring straight into my heart. Waving away the swirling dandelion seeds, I started walking towards the small fox. The fox raised its ears and its furry tail flitted across the grass as it turned and disappeared into the depths of the forest. I hurried and followed closely behind. In amongst the darkness of the trees, soft patches of white could be seen weaving between the shadows. Their silhouettes tip-toed like moonlight cast among the tree leaves, or like the hesitant strides of a crafty Seelie. With unfaltering trust, I followed the fox round and about, soon emerging from the dark forest in a seemingly faraway land. There, in the moonlight, a sea of dandelions lay before me, stretching as far as my eyes could see. Stunned by the sight, I began to notice a rustling noise coming from just behind me. It was a light, delicate sound. Like that of a girl walking barefoot across pine needles and leaves on the ground. The fox approached me from behind. The night air ferried her presence, cool and damp, whisked together with the slightly bitter fragrance of dandelion flowers. Two hands with slender, ice-cold fingers rested upon my shoulders. She leaned in close to my ear and her long hair draped down over my shoulder. Behind me, I felt the soft rhythm of both her breath and her heartbeat. It made me feel calm and at ease. "Only the foxes know the way to this place. It is the homeland of the dandelions. It is my desire that you would tarry here, and teach my child human language... In return, I will teach you the magic of foxes." There was a tickle in my ear, as if one of the dandelion seeds had grazed it on its journey into the warm night air. Strange. I had certainly never mentioned anything about magic to her before. How could she have known? Without answering, she took my hand and led me into the depths of the sea of dandelions. The night breezes from both north and south carried the bitter fragrance of dandelion flowers and faded memories... In those fields of velvet white, she showed me how foxes play gently together in their own fashion, until the moon rose high into the starry sky. Vol. 5 Upon accepting the Fox's conditions, he came to the place where all the prey who disappeared had eventually gone to — an endless field of dandelions. The story of the Hunter and the Fox in the sea of dandelions. The Fox in the Dandelion Sea, Part 5. In a boundless sea of dandelions that existed in the middle of nowhere, I watched as the seeds took off at the softest touch of the breeze. Suddenly, I knew the answer to that question that had been lingering on my mind for years. "So all the foxes that disappear during the hunt, this is where they hide away." I thought to myself. "What a beautiful place." But when I began teaching the little fox to speak our common tongue, my heart always felt empty, like a wind was blowing inside of me. When we talked, I would look into her gemstone-lake eyes. In those moments I felt like I was speaking not to the fox, but to a girl I used to love many years ago. And so, when she was around me, it was as if I were in the presence of the child of someone I had once loved: We had an enjoyable time together, but the experience was somehow tinged with sadness. But the thought of her promise — if I succeeded in teaching her child to speak the common tongue... "I shall impart the magic of transformation to you when the time comes." Remembering the way she made that solemn promise to me... I knew she was serious, and that gave me determination. Could I transform into a flying bird once I'd mastered the magic? How high would I be able to fly? Maybe I could transform into a fish, and finally have the chance to go to Musk Reef . "I could even use magic to hunt!" I couldn't contain my excitement. "No more meatless carrot stews for me..." I lost track of how long I stayed in the dandelion sea, where everything sways gently with the wind. One reason was that the little one was such a fast learner! I taught him not only our language, but everything I knew in one package, including how to count, how to grow carrots, how to change window panes, and how to sharpen knives. When it came to rest, we would talk idly. "Why must you learn human speech?" He answered swiftly: "So that when I transform into a human, I can befriend them!" I continued: "Why would you want to befriend the humans?" He dropped his gaze. Vol. 6 "Why do you want to learn the language of humans?" "So I can befriend humans when I become one." The child-like voice says, in the sea of dandelions. The Fox in the Dandelion Sea, Part 6. "Why must you learn human speech?" On one occasion, I asked the little fox this question. He answered cheerfully in the common tongue: "So that when I transform into a human, I can befriend them!" "Why would you want to befriend the humans?" This seemed to make him sad, and he dropped his gaze. "I saw a boy in the distant forest." "He was dressed in gray. He looked and had eyes like a wolf," he added. "I had just mastered my magic, and was running around excitedly on my hind legs. Running on grass was fun! But sadly, due to the difference in height, a fox can't see or smell the same things that a human can." "I'm sure you can guess what happened next, teacher! Suddenly, I realized a horrible truth — I was lost." There was pain in his voice as he relayed the events of that day. In the end, he had wandered into some faraway wood, and encountered vicious monsters. Just when he thought he was done for, the gray lupine boy suddenly leapt out of the forest and chased away the monsters. Without a word, he then turned around and vanished into the woods. "If I could transform into a human and speak their language, I could track him down and make friends with him!" He said gleefully. I couldn't help but ask when I heard his reply: "Am I not your friend?" The little one answered sincerely in the common tongue: "Mommy told me that it's different because you're my teacher — but I'd only hurt you if I tell you that." He tilted his head in befuddlement. His fluffy tail patted the surrounding dandelions as he pondered over this difficult issue. "I know!" He burst out. "If I know something that you don't, that would make me your teacher." "If we are both teachers, that would make us equals — then we can be friends!" Still unfamiliar with the common tongue, he did his best to get the sentence out quickly. "Teacher, please allow me to teach you some magic that only I know." Vol. 7 "Dandelion, Dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land," the Fox chants. Can the Hunter also learn magic to make his wish come true? The Fox in the Dandelion Sea, Part 7. "Teacher, please allow me to teach you some magic that only I know." Still unfamiliar with the common language, he did his best to get the sentence out quickly, eager to befriend me. He picked a little dandelion. "Dandelion, dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land." The little fox chanted. He blew the dandelion flower and sent the seeds flying. He then spoke in a more serious tone. "May my teacher's wishes ride the wind and reach the Anemo Archon." A wind blew past us and swept away the dandelion seeds. "See? The Anemo Archon has just answered my wish!" He exclaimed merrily. "What wish did you make?" "To become friends with my teacher." He lowered his head abruptly. "It must have been tiring to teach him to speak your language. Our mouths are structured differently from a human's, so I must thank you for your effort." We had not noticed the mother fox approaching. Her eyes were like bottomless lakes, and the little fox quietly hid himself among the dandelions to escape her gaze. "When he has mastered human language," I thought to myself. "When he has mastered human language," She said softly. Vol. 8 "When he has mastered human language..." The fox's voice is gently carried away by the midnight breeze, drifting further and further away together with the dandelion seeds... After all, the fox is a different kind of creature from the human, and the two do not share all the same sense of mirth and misery... "When he has mastered human language..." Thus she softly said. I looked at her face, mesmerized. I couldn't hear what she said after that. The mischievous night breeze was laden with dandelion seeds, which muffled her words. Or perhaps that was her native language? The language of dandelions? She began to laugh as she perceived my clumsy, gauche appearance. She had the most beautiful laugh. The curved pupils in her eyes glistened like two crescent moons shining on ripples in the lake. "Now, tell me then, why is it you wish to learn fox magic?" "I want to learn to transform just like foxes do. That way I could turn into a bird and fly to the highest of heights, and behold places that were once too far for my eyes to see." That was my reply. "Ahh yes, no longer will I need to lie in wait among the bushes while hunting. Instead, I will be able to freely soar high above like a falcon." Thus I kept thinking to myself. As I was thought to myself&#32;&#91; sic &#93;, the dandelion seed in my hand began to float up towards the moonlight, almost as if it had heard my thoughts. "I see..." She lowered her head slightly and her long, black hair flowed down her neck like a waterfall, glistening in the moonlight. Her pale white skin shone brightly, seemingly reflecting the wisps of clouds in the night sky above. I couldn't take my eyes off her. After a moment, I quickly turned my gaze away as I started blushing again. Foxes are free animals. They would never cover their beauty because of shame like humans do. Although this certainly wasn't the first time I beheld her, every time the moonlight shone upon her long hair, I couldn't help but blush and look away. She turned her face in thought for a moment, and let out a gentle sigh. She seemed rather displeased. We sat amidst the dandelion sea, not saying a word. A long time passed, long enough that I started thinking that she might be angry with me. "We foxes are grateful beings. I will teach you the magic of transformation, and so fulfill your wish." The fox said, turning her face towards me. Her lake-blue eyes shone in the moonlight, and it made me feel at peace. Thank goodness, she wasn't mad at me. For some reason I could not clearly name, I quietly heaved a sight of relief. Vol. 9 When I have taught all that there is to teach, will it be possible to see this sea of dandelions again...? In the dandelion sea, the hunter starts to contemplate leaving. Foxes are clever animals. Clever and cunning. The little fox learned very quickly, and could sometimes even ask questions that would stump me. For human speech is complicated and intricate, nothing like the innocence of animal speech. Sometimes, language is like a yarn ball caught in the paws of a cat. It catches here and there, and there again it catches a student's tongue, sometimes even tripping a teacher up. But foxes are clever animals, and very quickly they learn the many intricacies of human speech that were handed down over the generations, becoming able to describe the way dandelions float away, or how the moonlight shines over the lake in a rudimentary manner. Every time the little fox discovered a new word, every time he tried using unfamiliar words to explore a familiar world, to bestow meanings upon the wind, dandelions and the earth, she would be beside him, smiling, watching us. The little fox learned very quickly, but I did not take much joy from that. When I had run out of things to teach, would she still keep me here in this dandelion sea? When that time came, would I still be able to behold those beautiful eyes under the moonlight? Would she still lead me into the depths of the dandelion sea, smiling slyly as we frolicked and breathed in the bitter fragrance that came from both the north and south winds? As I thought about such things, I became lost in sullen memory. Yes, that's right. On that night that I could no longer remember clearly, when I was about to part with the girl I loved, this same moon had hung in the sky as well. "Thank you for everything up till now." Before I knew it, the fox had walked in front of me. She bowed, and her hair spilled over her shoulders, flowing like water in the glimmering moonlight. "Once he has learned human speech, he should be able to make more new friends." "I am truly thankful to you for all you've done. He has also cheered up significantly since beginning to learn the human language." She gazed at me, her deep, unfathomable eyes shining like jewels. "Still, once you have finished teaching us the human language, where will you go then?" Enraptured by those shining eyes, I forgot to reply. Was this fox magic, too? Seeing my wooden expression, the fox laughed and sighed. Then, she turned and began walking in the direction of the moon, leading me further into the center of the moonlit dandelion sea. Seeing this, the little fox swished its tail from side to side, and burrowed into the dandelion fields. Vol. 10 The somber parting has finally arrived... The Fox bids farewell to its mother, teacher, and the dandelion sea. It's time to live up to the promise. The Fox in the Dandelion Sea, Part 10. The little fox kept waving back to us as he walked. His figure grew smaller and smaller until it became a tiny white spot, which blended into the dandelion sea and slowly faded away. After he had gone, the mother fox turned and walked over to me. The closer she drew, the greater in stature she became. By the time she stood before me, she had transformed into a human. She was a tall and slender woman, with a swan-like neck and pearly skin. Her eyes sparkled like gemstone fragments in pools of water — in the darkness they seemed to shine like rays of sunlight on water after filtering through the treetops. "What a beauty. She looks a lot like the girl I fell in love with long ago, though I barely remember her name. Those eyes tell me she must be her." I thought to myself. For all the magic and transformation I had witnessed, still nothing amazed me quite as much as the gemstone lakes of her eyes. For a while, we stood silently in the boundless dandelion sea. At last, I could no longer contain myself, and opened my mouth: "Is this the magic you wanted to teach me? The magic of transformation?" "It is. I am most grateful to you for all your help over this long period." She bowed to me, her long silky black hair flowing down her shoulders like streams. Although saying farewell to the little fox left emptiness in my heart, I soon became exhilarated at the thought of the transformation magic that I was about to learn. Could I transform into a flying bird once I'd mastered the magic? How high would I be able to fly? Maybe I could transform into a fish, and finally have the chance to go to Musk Reef. "I could even use magic to hunt!" I couldn't contain my excitement. "No more meatless carrot stews for me..." "Then I shall ask you to stand still." She walked circles around me, her stature growing with every pass. No, not just her. The dandelions were also growing in size! They had only been at my ankles when she started, but now stretched to over my waist, growing as if turning into towering trees. It was only when I started to feel strange that I realized that the fox had become a giant. Vol. 11 "Dandelion, Dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land," the Fox chants. An unforgettable Mondstadt fairytale about a hunter and a fox. The Fox in the Dandelion Sea, the final installment. I started to feel strange, and then I noticed — I had turned into a dandelion! Even if I wanted to protest, the dandelion had no mouth nor tongue for me to make a sound. All I could do was watch helplessly as the giant gently picked the dandelion plant from the ground and held it between her thumb and index finger. "Dandelion, Dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land." The fox chanted. And then with a puff, the dandelion seeds began to dance in the air. I was caught in a storm and whisked away to a distant sky. The swirling made my head dizzy. Those eyes that glistened like gemstones in the lake had left me, along with my consciousness and the promise she had made. "Oh, Anemo Archon, I beg you to turn us into humans! For only then can we be safe from their hunting bows and knives." ... When I awoke, I found myself in the woods behind my village. The woods were full of lush trees, and at the center of the woods was a small lake. The lake was like the stained glass windows of Mondstadt Cathedral: crystal clear and shimmering in the sunlight. The sun shone through the treetops and glistened on the water's surface like fragments of gemstone. It was really something. The weather was cool that day. I was hunting in the forest when I arrived at the lake's edge. The shimmering water somehow reminded me of a girl I loved a long time ago. I couldn't remember much about her, but felt that her eyes must have looked like the lake, glittering as if harboring fragments of gemstone within. Hmm. I must have lost myself in thought that day, drifting off into sleep as I watched the sparkling lake.A long, long time ago, in the forest kingdom... What legends occurred there? The Boar Princess, Part 1. A story about friendship, love, and death. In the myths of ages past, every living being in this world had its own kingdom. Mondstadt was a forest in that age, a playground of the boars. In the forest was the Boar Kingdom, where everybody lived happily under the reign of the Boar King. The King had a lovely young daughter, who had the prettiest snout, the whitest tusks, and the smoothest fur in the whole kingdom. The Boar Princess, beautiful and kind, gave the juiciest and sweetest fruits to her subjects every day. From sweet and sour berries, to crisp apples, to delicious tree mushrooms, the Boar Princess always shared her delicacies first with her friends. Every boar in the kingdom adored their King and Princess, and every day they praised them so: "Oink, oink! Bless our King! As long as he reigns over us, we will never starve!" "Oink, oink, Bless the gentle Anemo Archon for giving our King such a kind and polite Princess!" (There are some words in the margin written in tiny handwriting: " dada , if I dont eat candy efery night, and i pray eferyday, will i turn into a wild piggy? i want to be a wild piggy because they are so tasty") Vol. 2 A lifeless ice field, a land even the gentle Anemo Archon has never visited. How is it that it still has its lonely inhabitants? The Boar Princess, Part 2. The story continues on the glacier. North of the boar forest was a frozen tundra. The playful Barbatos had not reached those lands, so they remained covered by ice and snow. Every creature who ventured there risked freezing their paws and hooves off. "It's cold, too cold! It's freezing! My claws are going to shatter!" Even the bravest, strongest Boar King could not withstand the frigid tundra. "Oink, oink, oink! My frozen snout is turning purple!" There lived but a single lone wolf pup in that place. (The childish handwriting at the bottom of the page reads: "dada, why does the little doggy have paws that don't freeze off in the cold?") Vol. 3 "Now and evermore shall you be bereft of hope." What fate awaits the wolf pup who bears such a cruel curse? The Boar Princess, Part 3. The pup was a carefree child who had bright blue eyes and slick gray fur. When he got angry, he looked exactly like the wolf head relief atop the Mondstadt Cathedral . But one day, when he was hunting in the forest, he ran into the evil squirrel sorcerer Woobakwa! Of all the beings in the ancient world, none were more evil than Woobakwa — not even demons and dragons . Woobaka&#32;&#91; sic &#93; despised everything nice, and swore to transform beauty into ugliness and turn light into dark. At the sight of the joyful wolf, anger boiled inside him. He cursed: "Squeak! Squeak! Angry am I! I shall spike his heart with the coldest ice, and he will never again know the meaning of hope!" With that said, Woobakwa began to curse the pup with his magic. But the rash pup gobbled him up, just like that, without the slightest warning. Woobakwa was so furious that he cursed the pup using the most foul and insulting words ever uttered by a squirrel. The pup felt the noise coming from his mouth, and only then did he realize his mistake. "Aroo, I'm so sorry, mister squirrel, I thought you were edible!" The pup wished to apologize to the squirrel, but he felt his throat tighten and then loosen. The squirrel slid down to his stomach with a gulp. (A sheet of paper bearing fine handwriting is taped to this page: " Lily , this is why you should eat cautiously when you're outside.") Vol. 4 The wolf pup grew up in the cold loneliness. The secret past of the lone wolf is now revealed. The Boar Princess, Part 4 No one knew just what chemical reaction occurred in the pup's stomach, but Woobakwa's curse magically came into effect! Because of the curse, the pup's heart was pierced and frozen by an icicle. The pup became cold and mean forever after, and whenever other animals showed kindness to him, he would repay them with the harshest of words or the most woeful of deeds. In the end, every animal loathed him. From then on, every wolf in the forest spoke of the pup in this way: "Woof, what a selfish wolf he is! Such an obnoxious kid." "Woof, woof, what a heartless wolf he is! Let us stay away from him." One by one, the pup lost all his friends. The forest welcomed the lonely pup no more, so he had no choice but to head north. The blizzards that blew in the northern tundra kept most creatures away. But with his heart already frozen solid, the pup was no longer afraid of the cold. He decided to settle down there, and became the lone wolf that roamed the tundra. (A young girl has written in the corner of the page: "Dada, but where did Woobakwa go?") Vol. 5 "No one deserves this fate." The good princess sheds a tear of compassion. For those who persevere as true companions, even the ice shall melt before their determination. The Boar Princess, Part 5 One day, the Boar Princess heard about the pup and was deeply saddened by his story. So she asked her people about how to defrost his heart and turn him back to his former sweet self. She asked and asked, but only the wise fox and the elderly turtle knew the answer: "Ack-ack-ack! Only sincerity and fire could melt such evil ice. Ack-ack-ack!" The fox replied. "Friendship demands sacrifice. No friendships come without sacrifices. I apologize for not knowing how to make funny sounds," the trustworthy Grandpa Turtle said. The clever Boar Princess knew right away what she had to do. She dried her tears and curtsied to the two wise animals: "Oink oink! Thank you! I would like you to go see the pup with me, so you could be the first to witness our friendship!" When the fox and the turtle heard the Boar Princess was willing to invite them on a royal trip, their hearts were full of joy. They set out with the Princess and headed north. (A handwritten note, seemingly from the young girl's father, is taped to the page: "Turtles can't make noises, no matter how hard they try. The reason Grandpa Turtle apologizes for this is just because he is very polite.") Vol. 6 The Boar Princess and her two wise companions brave an icy wasteland and scale a snowy mountain, where they discover a very mysterious inhabitant indeed... See how this high-altitude, low-temperature adventure unfolds in volume six of The Boar Princess. There is some childish handwriting on the title page, which reads: "daddy, when you get home, you have to read me the one about the snowy mountain too! And so, the Princess and her two wise companions arrived in the snowswept hinterland of the far north. Ice and snow covered the land as far as the eye could see. Neither the biggest, bravest animals nor even the weasel, who is the most skilled digger of them all, could find so much as a single blade of soft grass or a single piece of juicy fruit. The Princess was shivering from head to tail in the freezing cold, yet she was undaunted. Without even looking back, she pressed on deeper into the frozen wasteland. The wise fox and the trustworthy turtle could not bear the piercing wind and the freezing snow. They begged of the Princess: "Ack-ack-ack! If His Majesty the King knew that you were adventuring to such a cold and dangerous place as this, he would be very worried! Let's head back home... Ack-ack-ack," exclaimed the fox. "Yes, I agree! I fear the snowstorm will get stronger and colder with each passing second... Let us at least rest a while, and continue our journey once the wind has stopped and the sun is out? Once again, I apologize for not knowing how to make funny sounds," reasoned the turtle. It was to no avail. The persevering Princess did not heed the advice of her wise companions, but insisted that they continue to press on into the bitter cold of the far north. For what nobler cause could one pursue in this world than rescuing lost kin and rekindling lost friendships? Onwards they continued through the ice and snow, until their paws and hooves were purple from the cold, until each breath they exhaled turned into ice which became one with the swirling blizzard around them. Then, at the icy peak of a tall mountain, next to a frozen river which, in spite of everything, still flowed — albeit with icicles rather than water — the Princess met a spirit, swaying to and fro in the freezing wind. An ancient race of wise spirits lived atop that ice-capped mountain. They had no physical form, but possessed great magical power. "Oink oink! Are you the master of this place? Please, O Spirit, could you guide us through this snowstorm?" The Princess politely posed her question as her hooves, now numb from the cold, trembled in the snow. The wise fox and the trustworthy Grandpa Turtle also looked expectantly at the spirit of the snowstorm. As they gazed, their paws and flippers, respectively, numb from the cold, trembled in the snow. "Whoosh, whoosh..." The spirit of the snowstorm spoke softly. "Of course, but... whoosh, whoosh..." "In return, I will sap your energy. The further forward you go in the storm, the more tired and hungry you will become — though I assure you, it will not be life threatening... I hope... Whoosh, whoosh..." "Oink oink! This is, after all, the spirit of the snowstorm," pondered the Princess. "And I am also in the company of the two wisest, most caring members of my family. Whatever may happen, they will always be able to find a way!" Without a moment's hesitation, the Princess granted the spirit of the snowstorm her request. The wise fox and the trustworthy Grandpa Turtle had no time at all to formulate, let alone articulate, any remonstration. "Oink oink, I do declare this deal a fair one! Now, lead us to the wolf pup!" And so, the spirit turned into an ice stream, and carried the persevering Princess over the tall mountain... Vol. 7 All the sacrifices made out in the frozen plains were not in vain. The perfect ending of friendship, love, life and death! This is the end to the famous and touching story, The Boar Princess. After venturing through the bitter cold and the swirling storms, the Boar Princess finally met the pup. The pup was covered in ice. His once bright blue eyes had grown dim, and he had all but forgotten how to bark. "Aroo! You have come at the right moment, for I haven't had lunch yet!" Hearing his words, the kind Boar Princess could not help but shed tears. Her warm tears seemed to melt a little of the ice at the tip of the pup's heart. "Aroo! Why are you crying?" "Oink, oink! You are going to starve out here — I have never seen such misery in my kingdom!" "I will sacrifice everything to feed your hungry belly!" The pup was stupefied by her words. "Arooooooo! Miss, you must be mad! No one has ever dared say such things to me!" But when the pup saw the determination in her eyes, his frozen heart melted some more. "Nope! That's why...""I will sacrifice two of the wisest and most caring members of my family just to feed you! It is for the sake of our friendship!" The fox knew what horror she meant and attempted to run, but he was pinned to the ground by the pup and the Boar Princess. Grandpa Turtle was so frightened by the sight that he retreated into his shell. The pup and the Boar Princess enjoyed a delicious appetizer of fox out in the snow. Next, they found a cave, picked a few mushrooms, built a fire with some moss, and treated themselves to a tasty turtle soup. The pup felt the delight of sharing and making friends for the first time he could remember. His frozen heart melted completely, and he shed tears of joy. The Princess took the pup by his paw, and the two merrily returned to their home. (Wedged between the last two pages is a card bearing elegant handwriting: "Honey, I think it would be best if we donated this one to the library...")In ancient times when Axis Mundi was unobstructed, there were nine realms, each a world of its own. The realm of humans was known as the Zhongzhou, while the gods reside in Shenxiao. At the end of the last calamity, a war between the gods broke out. The God King fell, setting the nine realms ablaze, obliterating all living things. The realms have now been born anew, life again thrives, but the passageway between the nine realms by Axis Mundi has been sealed off. An all-new graphic novel on the epic journey in search of the God King's Halberd begins! —Pressing Official Businesses— "I am the Great and Glorious General Weiyang, emissary of the imperial court on a royal mission! I demand that you step aside at once!" "General? So the Great and Glorious is a military rank now, huh? I thought it was a civil office." Mir responded with not a moment's hesitation. Weiyang's face turned bright red. "Oh!? An ignorant borderland heathen seeks to educate me on the matters of the court!?" Mir was unfazed. "I would be surprised if they'd overhauled the entire government bureaucracy in the space of a few years." Two broad-sword-wielding Martial Artists in Weiyang's party burst out laughing. "Haha! So it ends our grand journey to the capital... The cart finally makes it past a thousand miles of checkpoints, only to get gridlocked like this at some tiny little inn out in the wlderness!" Qin stared intently at Weiyang's crimson-colored cheeks before suddenly declaring: "You're a woman! A female officer disguised as a man!" The claim was accentuated with a prod of his finger. "An astute observation," came the response from one of the martial artists. "She is in fact the Secretary of Ceremonies. The two of us are military officers. One from the Imperial Guards, the other from the Imperial Escorts, both versed in polearm and sword. We are serving the office of the Imperial Grand Minister on secondment, and we are here under orders to retrieve the Ominous Swords." "Although the part about the Great and Glorious Gen... General, haha... Although that's made up, the bit about being here on official court... uh, business is not," the other Martial Artist chimed in to say. The Ominous Swords were something that Mir had heard of. The story was that an iron meteorite had fallen from the sky five or six years ago, and convention dictated that as nature's treasure it belonged to the imperial family. However, a swordsmith by the name of Feng had taken it for himself and used it to illegaly cast nine swords. It was said that the Ominous Swords were cursed by the meteorite and could drain people's intellect. Naturally, they had caused quite the stir in martial artists' circles. "Good for you," said Mir as he shut the toilet door. "It'd be even better for me if you got yourself out from that toilet... now!" Her disguise exposed, Weiyang gave up trying to compose herself and spoke in her normal voice. She sounded more charming than one would expect, given the circumstances. "Officer Weiyang is a cultured lady of the court. Unlike us, she cannot resolve her pressing official business by simply finding a discrete spot in the wild. Please, hurry up!" Mir washed his hands and exited the toilet, then sat down at the table with the two Martial Artists. "it is not at every border town that we encounter one so familiar with court affairs." The one that seems to be the Imperial Escort officer sizes up Mir. "Might I inquire as to your personal history?" "My father, Mi Tingren, was Minister of Imperial Banquets. He was framed for embezzlement of funds intended for the imperial cuisine. He then resigned from his post and returned home." Mir paused to scratch his chin before continuing, "My old man's not been himself ever since that happened. I still intend to go back to the court one day and clear the Mi family name." Vol. 2 Mir, having stumbled onto the journey to retrieve the swords by accident, encountered a huge crisis before the journey had even begun. Imperial Guard and Imperial Escort elites were slain by enemies holding the Ominous Swords. Amidst grave danger, Mir recalled a spell taught by his father. Legend has that, the Celestial Emperor has a young daughter whose name was not known to the world; she now possessed Weiyang's body and revealed herself. Who would prevail? The wielders of the Ominous Swords who had turned into ferocious demons? Or Mir who could somewhat hold his own in a fight? —A Matter of Possession— "Yum. Very nice." Now that the spirit had possessed her body, Weiyang was of a much sweeter and gentler disposition. She took a tiny bite of one of Mir's stuffed pies, but it was too hot, so in an effort to avoid burning her tongue she stuck it out of her mouth and panted for breath frantically. Truth be told, it was all rather cute. "That came unexpectedly. I need some time to process." Mir, who had given up one of his eyeballs to appease the spirit, helped himself to a pie and asked, "Can you go over it again?" "Very well. The 'meteorite' was in fact a Divine Halberd. It was snapped into pieces by a commoner and made into nine cursed swords — the Ominous Swords. This one is the Sword of Mist, adding in that pair I've found three of them to date." "And what's your place in all of this?" "I was once the daughter of the Celestial Emperor. But I have long forgotten my name. I was in charge of conducting trials and sentencing at the end — a judge, to use your parlance." Since the Court of Imperial Entertainments was responsible for sacrifices and offerings, Mir's father had forced him to learn every last detail and word uttered in every known court ritual. And because most rituals involved encounters with bizarre forces and temperamental deities , he also knew a thing or two about how to deal with them. For instance, he knew that deities tended to guard their names closely, for knowledge of a deity's true name allows a human being to exercise absolute control over them. So he wasn't convinced this one had simply forgotten her name. "So the court wants to retrieve the swords to reconstruct the Divine Halberd?" Mir forced himself to entertain the reasonability of this line of inquiry. "I don't know. The master of this body knows nothing else. She is just... deeply angry. She wants to prove herself." Weiyang puts her hands on her chest. "So what's the next step? Do I have to perform some sort of farewell ceremony for you?" Mir stroked the bandaged and sightless eye. "And then do I get my eye back?" "Give me a name." She raised her head, oblivious to the crumbs at the edges of her mouth. "Don't be ridiculous. The imperial civil service examinations are overseen in person by the Emperor himself. How will I claim the title of Minister of Imperial Banquets with only one eye?" "Well, I have things to reclaim too: the remaining pieces of the Divine Halberd," she responded. "Otherwise, this world and everything in it is going to burn in hellfire." Mir kept looking at her, but did not respond. "You do not need to go with me. But with the fate of all living things at stake, please allow me to hold on to your eyeball for the time being." Vol. 3 "Just stay with the name 'Weiyang' for convenience's sake on the road. With the official documents from the government in hand, you should be free to go as you wish throughout the kingdom." Still worried about Weiyang, Mir decided to accompany her on her journey and kill any demons they may encounter. Though they had already collected five Ominous Swords and all seemed to be well, they knew in their hearts that the way forward would only get more treacherous and perilous. —A Dark Westward Journey— "This is all that I can do fo you," Mir said as he placed a series of dishes onto the table. He then sat down opposite Weiyang. Weiyang's right arm, which was broken in the fight to the death that had just taken place, was still wrapped in bandages. She stared intensely at Mir for a long while, but Mir just sat there resting his jaw on his hand and looking downards. Neither of them spoke. Finally, Weiyang attempted to use chopsticks with her left hand. But alas, her dexterity was found wanting, and she failed to procure a single meatball from the murky depths of the hot broth. Mir sighed, took the chopsticks from her hand, and said, "Fine, I'll feed you." "So there is still more that you can do for me," Weiyang suddenly quipped a few mouthfuls in. Her mood remained unchanged. "The Court of Imperial Entertainments is dedicated to worshiping and making sacrifices to all you divine beings up above. Serving you is my family's job." And in any case, when the gods make their move, what can mere mortals do but look on helplessly and accept their fate? — At least, that's what Mir thought. But he also thought it was better to keep that part to himself. "Couldn't you use your powers, though? I thought you said that each time you fight a&#32;&#91; sic &#93; Ominous Sword owner, you use telekinesis to make your polearm levitate, swing your sword around, and so on. Surely chopsticks can't be any harder?" "That is a power bestowed upon me by my father. Only I have this power. It is solely for use in sentencing the guilty. I mustn't..." Weiyang's voice changed in tone. "I mustn't use it lightly." "Before he died, that guy said something really strange about the situation with my father." Mir flicked the candle flame while he spoke to relieve his boredom. "'Minister Mi was neither innocent, nor wrongly accused.' What on earth did he mean by that?" If the court was unwilling to reconstruct the Divine Halberd, then being with the celestial emperor's daughter that had possessed Weiyang's body makes him an enemy of the imperial court. As if to signal that she had understood what Mir was thinking, Weiyang's face grew dark in the candlelight. She said, "You don't need to help me any longer. Your are a mere mortal, there is nothing to be gained from settling a score with the court." Mir replied, "Speak no more of this matter, I must get the truth out of my old man first." Weiyang said, "Oh.. we will pay a visit to your esteemed father? Then I must buy some fresh silk garmets and makeup first thing tomorrow morning." Mir replied, "He's just a regular old man. There's no neeed for all that." An unusually stern expression appeared on Weiyang's face. "Is this not your sworn duty?" Vol. 4 "Calm down, my son. Listen, Mir. I am not your real father..." "Noooooo!" The once Mister of Imperial Banquets was, in truth, Khan the Asura from Jotunheim. Leaving the capital was but an act in collaboration with the Minister of Ceremonies and the Grand Secretary to protect the daughter of the Celestial Emperor. "The late Celestial Emperor Shenxiao, the now Contra Mundi, was once a dear friend of mine. But now, knowing that you have successfully summoned her, all my wishes have been fulfilled." —Master Plan— Even a Buddha or an adeptus would have found themselves powerless to do anything in this situation. "This is the Sword of Flame, the 'Katakugosha.' It was made from the shard of the Divine Halberd that was the Dharani of the fire realm. Sorry... in language that your Majesty would understand, it's made with the runes of the fire realm, one of the God King's nine realms." How could this westbound warrior display such mastery of the sword? Most who had been stripped of the intellect by an Ominous Sword lose their fighting instinct and any martial arts they had learned. Weiyang nursed her broken arm and panted in the scorching hot air. Normally her abilities would enable her to fix broken bones, but the unquenchable flames burnt relentlessly at her wound. Her sight grew blurry as she lost blood. Mir stepped in from of her, guarding her from the warrior. "I can see that would have a lot of questions. Fine, I'll tell you everything! I killed your father because he tried to stop the resurrection of the God King. And the reason I can manipulate the fire realm runes rather than the other way round is because..." The warrior from the east raised the Ominous Sword. "Is because I am a warrior of Hunt From Above made flesh..." Legend has it that the Celestial Emperor once went to war with the Asura. To prepare for the war, the Celestial Emperor selected soldiers from three realms and made them ascend to become his celestial army after death. Sometimes, they were beset by inclement weather on the marsh, with thundercloud tornados surrounding them. The people of Zhongzhou referred to it as the soldiers of the celestial army "hunting from above." "No... Impossible!" A look of disbelief appeared on the warrior's face as the Ominous Sword broke into pieces, and he, too, was sent flying from his own soldiers towards whatever destiny had in store for him next. In the chaos, Mir hand brought out the sword his father had left him as inheritance. It was intended as more of a gesture of defiance than a genuine attempt to fight back. But unbeknownst to him, this was the greatest cursed sword of all, that had once burned the entire world to cinders: Laevatain. If the fire-realm runes constituted the mystery of the fire realm, Laevatain was its pure unadulterated, unquenchable reality. The sword had extinguished after the world was burned, but having assimilated the rune of the fire realm, it burned bright once more. "The whole world... destroyed again..." Weiyang fell unconscious as she spoke. Vol. 5 "There are many among the military officials who wish to unseal Axis Mundi since the world in chaos would greatly elevate the position and importance of the Martial Artists." "They want to wage another War of the Asuras?" "He does." The tug-of-war between the civil and military officials and the schemes of the past gods once again threatens all of the nine realms! —Legacy of a Goddess— "Your deeds have saved the people. You are indeed a great warrior." The crown prince, hands clasped behind his back, walked in circles around Mir, who lay prostrate on the ground. But Mir was unmoved by his words. "Hand over the Divine Halberd and you may have the title of Minister of Imperial Banquets. Grand Secretary will be yours too within a decade, if you want it." The crown prince sat down. "Well? What is your response?" "A lowly commoner dares not speak till His Majesty permits him to rise." "Hmm... but now if I granted you permission to speak, it would be because you instructed me to do so... We can't have that! As future lord of all the land—" "Pff. What a charade this is," said Mir as he switched to a more relaxed position. "The official etiquette of the ruling dynasty does not require kowtowing for an audience with the crown prince. It should just be the regular thrice greeting. I noticed that you were on track to become Emperor, so I thought I'd come pay my respects. There's just no need to lord it over me like this." "You... you..." "What about me?" Mir snapped as he stood up. "I will give you half of the Divine Halberd. The Dharani of the fire realm, I will offer to father. Mostly to avoid another situation where we have remnants trying to stir up trouble." "Can't, uh, can't hurt. As long as the portion I get looks the part it'll be fine. This is gonna be known as the new national superweapon! Hahaha..." Mir sat down impatiently right in front of the crown prince. "I don't understand how you are such a fool when we were both raised under the same mother's milk!" "How dare you! I have nothing but respect for Lady Mi serving as my wet nurse. And it's only because of the virtues she instilled in me that I am able to put up with your—" "Give the title of Minister of Imperial Banquets to someone who cares. I'm going home." The crown prince said nothing. "How about Weiyang?" Mir chewed his food and acted nonchalant. "Oh, for the meritous act of retrieving the swords, she was promoted to Secretary of Ceremonies. She was not implicated in the evil plot by her father, the Imperial Grand Minister. The Minister of Ceremonies and the Grand Secretary both testified. I will see her every need is met." Something sounded odd about that. But that was fine. She was gone, and his eye was restored. But to this day there was still a dull ache, like the phantom pain of a missing limb. Vol. 6 Mir once again chanted the forgotten spell. The maiden was reunited with him again. "So, this is what you truly look like." "The world is beyond repair. It shall be born anew from the ashes of the last." The mad Celestial Emperor sentenced all living things of the world to a hard punishment. "But you, you would understand me, wouldn't you?" The nameless thief who stole the national treasure said this to his lord. "No. No apologies necessary, for you are benevolent." —Nothingness— "Oh my daughter, the one in whom all my hopes are placed! Did I not bring you into existence that you might one day pierce me with a halberd?" Awakened at last, the God King floated in the heavens to the claps of thunder and the dancing of the wind, rejoicing at his return. But she was no longer afraid. This was the moment she had been waiting for her entire life, the moment she had been made for all those eons ago. No — that was not it. The true source of her courage was the time she had spent with him. The first Divine Halberd, Irmin, once pierced the Axis Mundi and connected the nine worlds. Now, its replicas had proliferated across the heavens. Fearing the madness that would ensue following his death, the God King made one final Divine Halberd, and named it the Prinzessin der Verurteilung. In this moment, it — nay, she — could finally unleash her true self. ... A commentary from the editor appears at the end of the book: Legend of the Shattered Halberd was a successful first attempt by Inazuma 's Yae Publishing House to incorporate elements of Liyue culture in one of their novels. The first five volumes were wildly successful, becoming something of a cultural phenomenon in both Inazuma and Liyue. Commercially, the fact that a sixth volume exists at all speaks to its success. I trust that the abrupt finale to this epic saga brought by volume six will not be to our readers' displeasure. I hope. Though the ending reads like a different story entirely, I must stress that this did not arise from any attempt on our part to pressurize Mr. Nine, the author, into developing material for a new series. The truth is that in his rush to meet the publishing schedule, Mr. Nine ended up diverging somewhat from his usual style. Mr. Nine simply wished to challenge himself as a writer. xe2x99xa1 Naturally, we are sympathetic to the fans of the original First Five volumes. In this spirit, we would like to announce that a special First Five collector's edition, the Blackwood Box Set, is currently in the making. Those who have grown up reading Legend of the Shattered Halberd in bookstores: this is the time to finally buy it for yourself! Also, expect to hear more tales of the Prinzessin der Verurteilung in the future.

collection of fantasy stories centered around a mysterious antique shop. It's widely popular around Teyvat. —Moonlight— Legend tells of a corner of the city that has been forgotten by the wind. To reach that place one must stand before the fountain and close their eyes, then wait for thirty-five heartbeats, then walk seven circles clockwise around the fountain followed by seven further circles anticlockwise. Upon opening one's eyes, one will find they have arrived at a little shop... ———— "Excuse me, is... is anyone there?" Veiga asked timidly as she stepped through the door. As the door closed behind her, the bell that hung from it rang out, its crisp and clear sound filling the room and cutting through the dimly lit drudgery. The dull glow of twilight seeped gently through the frosted glass of the display case windows. Stacks of curious objects filled every part of the room. Veiga made her way through the store cautiously, for fear of stepping on something and breaking it. There was no answer. Veiga now began to examine the objects around her more closely: an obscure mechanical component, an ornate ancient lyre, a broken ceramic tile engraved with incomprehensible markings, a pair of old manacles, dented and scratched from years of use, a forgotten crown that once belonged to an aristocrat... At some point as she was inspecting these objects of no apparent utility, the shopkeeper appeared beside her. The shopkeeper's eyes were like those of a fox, with long slender pupils at their center. "That fang once belonged to a wolf king. Aside from the gods, it is probably the only thing left that remembers that land the way it used to be... every inch of it covered in ice and snow." She spoke softly, "Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your fancy?" "Do you have anything here that can help someone... to forget?" "Why, certainly." Veiga clutched her chest as she pursued the question further. "... To forget anything? Even... someone very important?" The fox-eyed shopkeeper's expression turned stern, and she nodded as she continued: "I know that the one you wish to forget is a young man with limpid eyes as clear as moonlight. He disappeared a long time ago, and left a deep hole in your heart. Nothing else can fill that hole... all other blessings, no matter how joyful they may be, feel elusive and out of your reach... just like the moonlight before your eyes." Veiga was stunned into silence. All she could do was nod along. The fox-eyed shopkeeper smiled and, seemingly out of nowhere, presented a bottle of wine. "This wine will help you forget your pain." "Long time ago in the age when the icy winds blew, our forebears brewed this wine in secret, deep within the frozen earth, to give them the strength to keep surviving. The method they used to brew this kind of wine was forgotten when the people's fate took a turn for the better, and their lives became more joyful." She tilted the wine bottle back and forth. "There is not much left. And since it seems you have an affinity with this store, this one is for free. Provided, of course, that this is what you really want..." Veiga took the goblet of wine from the fox-eyes shopkeeper's hand. The goblet must have once been adorned with a precious gemstone. But it had since been removed, and now the only clue to its existence was the empty, lonely indentation it had left behind... When Veiga regained consciousness she was stood in front of the fountain. "Hmm? What am I doing here?" She wondered to herself. As the moon shone down brightly, she began briskly walking back home. The glow of twilight had all but disappeared now, and if she didn't get back soon... She had forgotten all about the strange store, from the route that had taken her there to everything that had happened inside. ———— "She's gone." The fox-eyed shopkeeper said, after the door had shut and the bell had stopped ringing. A young man, one with limpid eyes as bright as moonlight, stepped into view from the back of the store. "Thank you." "How many times has she visited now?" "Six... No, seven. Seven times." The young man hesitated for a moment, and then asked, "Does the wine really work? It's not that I don't trust you, it's just—" The shopkeeper smiled, though the meaning of her smile was ambiguous. "This wine causes those who drink it to forget their pain. But your shared history is not a painful thing for her. All this wine can do is to help her temporarily forget her longing for you, and the grief of losing you..." "Whenever she sees the moonlight, she will see you reflected in it, and the memories will start coming back... the time you met at Ludi Harpastum , the afternoon spent beneath the tree at Windrise, the view from Cape Oath, the time you sneaked out of the midsummer celebrations together, hand in hand, the song and the feathered cape you offered to her at the assembly of traveling bards... All of these are memories she will be reluctant to part with." "... I do have another bottle of wine in my shop, one that can make someone truly forget everything. If you wish... I could give her that drink, instead?" She smiled slightly as she watched the young man. After a long silence, he let out a sigh. "Tell me — why do you insist on leaving her?" "Ah, well... it's this. This is the reason." The young man reached into his breast pocket and took out a spherical object made of crystal. Unknown symbols could be discerned faintly flickering inside it. "I am led to believe that people who receive one of these will one day disappear from this world." "If that is so, then the earlier I leave, the better. She is still young... if she forgets me now, then she will still have time." "Well, well, well..." sneered the shopkeeper. "So. You are one of the chosen." "It would appear so. Do you... know anything about what happens to the chosen in the end?" The young man asked eagerly. She forced a smile, but did not reply. "I should be leaving. Now I am the owner of this thing, I suppose I should get on with doing the things that are expected of me." "And if she returns? What would you have me do?" "I think... I think we should leave her to handle it on her own." "What a heartless man you are." Vol. 2 A collection of fantasy stories centered around a mysterious antique shop. It's widely popular around Teyvat. —Glaze— Legend tells of a corner of the harbor that has been forgotten by the mountain rocks and the sound of the crashing waves. To reach that place one must stand in the sea breeze and close their eyes, walk forty-nine steps away from the clamor of the crowds, then wait till the sound of one's own heartbeat drowns out the voices in the background. Upon opening one's eyes, one will find they have arrived at a little shop... ———— "Hello? Anyone in?" Yu'an called out. He tried the door, and let himself in. The bell continued to ring after the door had closed and as he made his way further inside. The faint sound of crashing waves seeped into the store, like a distant memory. Piles of seemingly random artifacts were stacked all the way through from where he stood to the other end of the long and narrow shop. Yu'an looked apprehensively at the range of items throughout the store, somewhat intimidated by the thought of his silken robes being covered in dust that was potentially even older than he. Old lanterns made of now-yellowing paper, a giant fang from some unknown monster, brilliant black aerosiderite from the depths of space, a dull gold-colored geometric object built with a mortise and tenon crafted from an unknown material... As he picked up a small bottle filled with a fine white crystalline powder, he heard a soft voice coming from someone who was now stood next to him. "This is salt formed from the residue of an ancient archon 's tears—" The voice caught him off guard, breaking the long silence like a stone disrupts the surface of a pool of still water. Startled, he dropped the bottle he held in his hand. But the sound of smashing glass his ears were anticipating never came. The shopkeeper, who had fox-like eyes with slender lines for pupils, had somehow caught the bottle and returned it to its place on the shelf. "I'm, er... Huh, I can't remember who it was, but... someone recommended this place to me." She gave a slight nod that acknowledged she had heard him, but was ambiguous as to what she thought about it. "Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your fancy?" "I'm looking for a gift for... she's a girl I like." "I've been thinking of proposing to her, and I'd like to have a gift to go with it." Yu'an nervously bit his lower lip as he looked up to face the shopkeeper directly. She had mysterious golden eyes that reminded him of Cor Lapis. They looked at each other for a long time in silence. Finally, she spoke: "Very well." Her slender figure disappeared back into the depths of the store. When she returned, she held in her hand an object that gave off a faint iridescent glow. On closer inspection, it revealed to be an exquisitely cut ten-sided illuminating crystal. "I trust you will have heard the legend of the crystal heart?" He hadn't. But he nodded anyway. "It is made from a variety of crystal called illuminating crystal. Man-made versions exist, but they are pale imitations. True illuminating crystal is capable of revealing the secrets of one's heart, for it is formed from the unfulfilled desire and grief of illuminated beasts of the highest order when they reach the end of their life. Please, take a look..." She gestured to Yu'an that they should both watch the faintly flashing images emerging from within the crystal. Tens of thousands of years flashed by before his eyes. Like the continuous shifting of the clouds, stars turned to water and water turned to land. Snow melted and gave way to green pastures. Rivers cut their way through the open country. He watched cities rise like ants' nests and kingdoms topple like toy building blocks... ...The twilight grew dim. Moonlight zigzagged its way across the uneven surface of the ocean. When Yu'an regained consciousness, he found himself walking by the docks. The crystal he held tightly in his hand had become warm, as if blood pulsed through it. "This is a wondrous crystal heart indeed," he thought to himself, increasing his pace as he walked on under the moonlight. "All I need to do is give this to her... Once that's done, then I can... I must..." ———— The bell that hung from the door rang out, crisp and clear. "Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your fancy?" "I'd like to exchange this — well, I don't know if it counts as a gemstone, or..." The finely cut crystal sparkled brightly, scattering rays of light throughout the room. "It was given to me by a man who's been pursuing me. He said that if we looked into it together, we would see many marvelous things." "But somehow I just find it makes me feel uncomfortable. It's a beautiful gem, of course, I just... each time I think of him, I get so exasperated. So I wondered if this store would be willing to take it off my hands." "I understand. But this is a highly prized ten-sided illuminating crystal. For what quantity of Mora would you be willing to part with it?" "Actually, I do not want for money. But let me see... what's this — it looks like salt? It's about time I went to Sal Terrae to pay my respects again. If it's okay with you, this is all I need in return for the gem." ———— The fox-eyed shopkeeper sat alone at the back of the shop, turning the geometrically flawless crystal in her hand. "In you, I have seen unpleasant things. That fellow's true nature, it is unbelievable... it is upsetting." "That said, when it comes down to it he is but a lowlife opportunist who wishes to marry into a wealthy and prestigious family in the salt industry , and will do whatever is necessary to achieve his wish. Had this not come to light, it is entirely possible that they may still have enjoyed a happy life together, despite it not being born out of genuine mutual affection. After all, happiness is but a state of mind - it is not related to love." She took a dainty sip of wine, and smiled mockingly at the thought of her own vanity. "But the fact is, I simply have zero tolerance for people like that." "On the other hand, it is delightfully straightforward opening up to a complete stranger. I know that once he sets foot outside that door, we never have to meet one another again - so what does it matter if I reveal a little truth to him? Perversely, the closer two people become, the more one seeks to gain, and so you must be on your guard. But how could he have known..." "I'm sorry, this has all been quite the imposition on you. But it is truly wonderful to have this back." She lowered her gaze and continued, "This is, after all, your heart that you have left behind. I will be sure to treasure it... But don't you think it's fun? Taking a trip down into the world once in a while, seeing what people are like nowadays?" Vol. 3 A collection of fantasy stories centered around a mysterious antique shop. It's widely popular around Teyvat. —Sapphire— Legend tells of a corner of the city that has been forgotten by the wind. To reach that place one must stand in the center of the plaza and close their eyes, walk seven circles clockwise around the plaza followed by seven anticlockwise circles, take forty paces forward and then wait till the cries of the birds can no longer be heards in the wind. Upon opening one's eyes, one will find they have arrived at a little shop... ———— The shopkeeper, who had fox-like eyes with slender lines for pupils, opened the glass double doors to let in the bright moonlight, which seemed to sweep up the stardust from across the night sky and sprinkle it down upon the counter. Everything, from the ostentatious flowers, the dust-covered harpastum, and the old books rendered illegible by years of erosion, to the now-stringless old longbow, appeared as the opulent halls of the ruling aristocrats might have done in times of old — covered in a shiny silver coating, though this was a silver that came from the cold light of the night sky. "Hey. Business any good these days?" This audacious alternative to the courteous greeting most people would opt for in the circumstances came from somewhere deep in the back of the shop. The shopkeeper turned around. A familiar customer was sat nonchalantly on her armchair in the part of the shop that the moonlight did not reach. "Business is fine. But these days, it would appear, I need to watch out for burglars." The shopkeeper responded with a slight smile. "That's it? You're going to turn away your oldest customer, just like that?" The customer let out a sigh, "There's nothing in your shop that's worth me spending money on anyway. I mean, if I really had to pick something..." "Well? How was the... hunt?" "What do you mean? You think I'm just here to offload some loot again?" The "hunter" let out a displeased grunt at the shopkeeper's insinuation. But the shopkeeper continued to smile. "Why, of course not. When have I ever heard you use the word "loot" before?" "On the contrary... all the "exchanged goods," "free gifts," "philanthropic donations," "bestowals" and so on that you have so generously given over the years... why, they must make you the most charitably inclined burglar to roam the streets, no?" "Well, that's not why I'm here this time. This time I am here to ask for something from you... the wine. That special wine you've got that helps you forget about the one you long for." Though a burglar by trade, this customer was nevertheless valiant at heart. His words lacked courtesy, but the smile on his face was entirely earnest. "I'm terribly sorry. Somebody has already bought it." He looked, and somehow, she was now holding in her hand the wine flask that he had discreetly slipped into his breast pocket earlier. "Each item in this store is spoken for. This particular one has already been bought by a customer who will turn up at some point in the future." "It seems your sleight of hand is superior to my own. What a disgrace I am..." The burglar of valor said with a pained smile. "I discovered recently that the feeling of longing for someone is heavier to carry than gold. In my line of work I am forever leaping between rooftops and running along rafters. I need to cut out whatever... unnecessary weight I can." "...I wonder if the girl with the sapphire-blue eyes feels the same weight that I feel?" ———— Suddenly, the shopkeeper was startled by the jingle of the door bell. The customer who had just arrived was a blue-eyed sorceress with a Pole in her hand and a tall, slender figure to match. The marks on her face bore witness to her persecution by the aristocrats. Ignoring the piles of random objects strewn around the store, she marched straight to the counter like a sword lunging toward its opponent's heart. "Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your fancy?" "I have an item I wish to exchange." her tone sounded cold but fragile, like thin ice in the moment that it shatters. As the sorceress spoke, she placed a giant blue crystal onto the counter. "A burglar pried this from an aristocrat's silver goblet. He gave it to me as a gift, and then I was punished by my master for it." "But that was many years ago. I had thought that with the passage of time my anger would be quenched and my desire to see him again would fade away..." "Very well. What sum of Mora do you ask for in return?" The sorceress gestured toward the tableware cabinet, in which stood an aristocrat's silver goblet with its gemstone missing. The fox-eyed shopkeeper turned the crystal in her hand, flooding the room with the brilliant blue light that reflected off its surface. "I see. Well, provided that this is what you really want..." When a person encounters a setback, the worry that everything shall come to a fruitless conclusion appears. The advent of fear causes cracks to appear in the mind. Death follows easily in the footsteps of fear, like a damp cold that, to the unprepared, pierces to the bone. For many, it is only in the moment that death is upon them that it dawns on them that their weakness has now been targets with fatal consequences — and that at some point, therefore, that weakness must have been exposed. Lifting the blue crystal up into the moonlight, the shopkeeper gazed at it intently with her fox-like eyes with slender lines for pupils. She watched with delight as the crest of the ruling family came into view, faded out, and came back into view once more. Legends claim that peering into a pure gemstone at a specific time can reveal the past, the future, and even someone's true nature. Just as legends claim that somewhere in the world, there is a field of dandelions as vast as the sea . Or that once there were three bright moons in the night sky named Aria, Sonnet and Canon , sisters who were parted by death in a great catastrophe . Or that there was once a witch who could see death before it took place, but in the end herself died from the broken heart, as he who had stolen it from her waited in distant lands longing to see her again. One thing she knew for certain was that even if she were to abandon these objects, the legends attached to them would not disappear, and the way the stories ended could not be undone. In which case, it seemed to make sense to collect all the legends and stories she could in her shop. Vol. 4 A collection of fantasy stories centered around a mysterious antique shop. It's widely popular around Teyvat. —Heart of Stone— Legend tells of a corner of the harbor that has been forgotten by the mountain rocks and the sound of the crashing waves. To reach that place one must stand in the sea breeze and close their eyes, walk forty-nine steps away from the clamor of the city streets, then wait until complete silence replaces the sounds of the voices in the background, the only remaining sound being that of one's own heartbeat. Upon opening one's eyes, one will find they arrived at a little shop... ———— "Is anybody in?" The man tapped on the front door as he called out. He was draped in a raincoat. He peered in through the dusty windows at the objects on display around the store — a bottle of glimmering stardust, a broken blade that gleamed like ice, a painting on a roll of paper that the years had turned yellow, an elixir that gave off a mysterious aurora, a tile thinly coated with gel-like substance... He entered the store. The door closed behind him. He walked over to the counter and began inspecting the weird and wonderful objects in the store. All seemed to be relics of a bygone era. Then, a soft female voice came from beside him. "Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your fancy?" Taken by surprise, he turned to face the speaker, a fox-eyed shopkeeper, who let out a faint smile. "Here's the thing... I'm looking for a certain something that can help me settle and old score." The man spoke with a voice that was clear and resonant, but that had a hint of apprehensiveness about it — one which did not seem to fit with his physical appearance. "Oh? Very well then." The shopkeeper's golden fox-like eyes flickered as she examined this new customer of hers who was draped in a soaking-wet raincoat. She gave a nod. She leaned down to search in the bottom of the cabinet. When she stood up a moment later, she was holding a large and beautiful piece of Cor Lapis. The Cor Lapis in the shopkeeper's hand gently glowed a dark shade of gold, much in the same way that her eyes did. The man took the stone from her hand and studied it closely in the moonlight. In this light, the Cor Lapis seemed to reveal a deep turbulence concealed within its soft golden hue. His hands were still trembling. "Cor Lapis is the soul of the rocks. Even the hardest and most resilient of rocks will, over time, eventually produce a pure, limpid sould." The shopkeeper's voice seemed to be coming from a distant place. The man gave a nod. "This is precisely what I was looking for." The man solemnly responded, and placed a heavy sack of Mora upon the counter. Then, he left the store and ventured off into the midnight rain. ———— "That's what happened." After the shopkeeper had spoken, she narrowed her fox-like eyes and examined the customer in front of her. "Did he say nothing else at all? Judging by his appearance, the young man was presumably a miner. His eyes betrayed an urgency that he could not contain. But the shopkeeper responded simply by calmly shaking her head. "He left a sack of Mora with blood stains on the outside." Like a pool of water, the shopkeeper's voice was calm and still, but also icy cold. "That is precisely what I was looking for." The young man let out a long sigh. It seemed he wanted to evade the golden gaze of the fox-eyed shopkeeper. "In return, I will give you a story." The shopkeeper nodded her head to indicate that he should continue. "That man in the raincoat... I used to go mining with him, up in the mountains. I wanted to make a name for myself. He just wanted to support his family..." "One rainy night we broke open a rock to find that substantial piece of Cor Lapis inside. The pure golden glow that radiated from its surface was a more breathtaking sight to behold than all the marvels of Jueyun Krast put together..." "We agreed that we would split it fifty-fifty once we got back to Liyue Harbor. But that night, under cover of the deafening roar of the torrential rain... I discreetly made it so that that clifftop would be his final resting place..." "I did it because I was scared I couldn't trust him... I couldn't trust in a promise that, aside from ourselves, only the adepti could have heard — and they're probably imaginary anyway." "So... Fear won me over. I could bring myself to accept that the whole sum could be mine if I was willing to get blood on my hands, but I couldn't bring myself to accept the risk of traveling with a stranger..." "The following morning, I let down my rope and began my descent down the cliff. I had taken maybe four steps, five or six perhaps, and I was adjusting my footing on a rock when suddenly, I felt the rope trembling in the palms of my hands... Instantly that same trembling permeated every fiber of my being..." "I lifted my head to look at the rope, but it was too late..." "The last thing I remember seeing was the rope fibers at the end of the snapped rope." "Only a hunting knife could have made a clean cut like that. I am sure of it." "Then, in the end, you two settled your score." The fox-eyed shopkeeper smiled so faintly it was all but indiscernible. "He takes the Cor Lapis, and you take the whole sum of money for it." The young man did not say much in reply. ———— Legends claim that Cor Lapis is the soul of the rocks of the earth, and that the stronger the life force of the rock the more power it possesses to reveal a person's true nature. Some say that even after its owner has left the world, Cor Lapis will bring their unfulfilled desire and regret back into it, waiting for one with the ability to fulfill them. So the legends claim. It had now been around four hours since the two strange customers had left the store. The rain continued to pour down. The shopkeeper stood by the window for a long time, peering out at the dark street engulfed in misty rain. "But... Is the score truly settled? Are are they now truly free?" She spoke as if posing her question to the curtain of rain, but knowing that the answer would never come.Sometimes, feelings are like the summer rain, coming out of nowhere and catching you unprepared. A nostalgic summer story set in the age of aristocrats begins right here. As is known to all, the Lawrence clan is a noble family of considerable notoriety. The nobles idle away their time, extorting the common folk to furnish their lavish lifestyles. They lead licentious lives. Under their cruel governance, countless unspeakable crimes are committed against the people. Although the common folk unanimously resent the nobles' greed, they are powerless to speak a single word against them. Young Dietrich was a highborn noble. He hadn't yet committed any deplorable crimes at his tender age. In fact, his swordsmanship was reputedly exceptional among the noble circles. If you wished to find something to cavil about, it would have been his short temper and chronic delusion that the whole universe revolved around him. Such traits, of course, are not uncommon among the sons of nobility, so it wasn't of any major concern. However, given that he was born into the Lawrence family name, it was only a matter of time before he would get drafted into the ranks of the other scoundrels. It was at this time that the young scoundrel decided upon the first reckless act of his life. A short while earlier, Dietrich had made up his mind to skip Tutor Damo's discourse on the elements in favor of a bit of fun outside the confines of the city. As he pressed his way through the streets crowded with commoners, his gaze fell upon a young lass with blonde hair and blue eyes. Dietrich was at a loss for words for the emotions that bubbled in his heart at that moment. The only thing he was certain of was that his heart had never thumped so loudly, or so uncontrollably, within his chest. "So this must be how dear Mother feels when she sees her kitty." As Dietrich kept thinking in his heart, he suddenly found himself moving towards where she was standing. Much to his dismay, the young commoner girl didn't so much as bat an eyelid at him. After making his identity known to her, she didn't display even the slightest sign of any interest. Convinced that this commoner didn't understand what was good for her, he decided that he would carry her off under the cover of night. "Once I take her, I'll lock her away in a cage, just like dear Mother would when her kitty is being naughty." Vol. 2 Money doesn't solve all your problems, but it can certainly solve a lot of them! A young woman's summer vacation in Mondstadt opens to the melodic tune of a symphonic sum of Mora. The plebian lass arrived in the city on one fine sunny day. Her long golden hair shone like the spring sunshine, and her blue eyes sparkled like the gleaming waves in the afternoon sun. It's hard to imagine how such a girl could travel alone from the monster infested outskirts all the way to the city. "To call her suspect would only be an insult to her beauty!" Thus shouted the drunken gate sentry among the crowded tavern. His earnings from guarding the gate that day were especially bountiful, enough to keep his cup brimming until dawn at least. "We all know you were just dumbstruck by her beauty!" The man next to him pulled no punches. "Hah, what do you know! Do I look like one to go frolicking after ladies? I'll show you what I really have my eye on!" The soldier promptly pulled out his money purse and shook it in his hand. "Good heavens! Today, drinks are on you!" "You heard the man, drinks all around! I'm just worried that one more will be too many for ya!" ... So this traveling scholar who went by the name of Nottie settled into her newfound life in the city. Nottie spoke in a quiet, gentle manner. A rumor eventually began floating around the streets claiming that if you exchanged a few words with Nottie during the day, you would have sweet dreams the following night. Apart from this, the new girl didn't disturb the lives if those in the city in any manner. After all, the people not only had their daily lives to deal with, but also the constant oppression from the nobility. "Oh, I thought life in the city would be simple. I never imagined it would be like this..." As rays of sunset filled her room, she tilted her head and rested it on her hands. Sitting beside the table, her fingers seemed to be circling around something. Her words flowed like a magical chant with the power to persuade people into believing almost anything. Vol. 3 Even when you live in a safe city, you should watch out for the wolves that lurk in the night... Something more impossible to master than mass hypnosis is revealed within these pages. Night came. The faint howl of a wild beast could be heard echoing in the distance. It seemed to be the cry of a wolf. Nottie sat on her bed and lifted her long sleeves to reveal a bone-white armband carved in the fashion of a coiling snake. The serpent's head was strikingly lifelike with its mouth stretched open to reveal its fangs. Its neck was reared back as if ready to pounce on its prey the very next moment. The snake's slithering body was wrapped around her arm, emitting a dangerous aura under the rays of the magical lamps that lit the room. "Goodnight, my dear sister." Nottie gently petted the armband, rubbing her pinkie playfully along the snake's tail. Shortly after, the magic lamps went out and the entire room was draped in darkness. The darkness of night brought Nottie boundless power. So Nottie was already wise to the unknown presence the moment it entered the room. Sitting on the bed, Nottie could clearly see Dietrich as he quietly gathered her clothes and felt his way around in the dark. It became harder and harder for Nottie to hold back her laughter, until Dietrich was just in front of her. Dietrich met the same dazzling eyes that occupied his mind all day. But her eyes were somehow different now. They were no longer blue like water as Dietrich had seen that day. At this moment, they were filled with the night, devoid of waves, tranquil like the depths of the sea. "Here, drink the water in this cup." That was the last thing Dietrich heard before his consciousness faded away. Vol. 4 Even a dog can learn basic things like upper-class etiquette — or so insists a certain no-nonsense teacher from afar. The cup fell from his languid hand as Dietrich collapsed to the floor. Nottie crouched beside Dietrich and relieved him of the saber sheathed upon his waist. She stroked the hilt of the blade for a moment before pulling back her hand, and a black gemstone that had been inlaid in the hilt fell into her palm. "How convenient... You brought the Eye of Eternal Night right to me. Thank you." Removing the snake armband as she spoke, she placed the black gemstone in the mouth of the snake. Scales and flesh began to quickly ripple from the snake's head down its body. A small black snake uncoiled in Nottie's hands, slithering off her palm and falling to the floor. The snake began to enlarge, forming into a massive python with red eyes and black scales, its twisting body almost filled the whole room. Nottie extended her hand as the magical lamps illuminated the room, the python began to shrink down again and coiled back around her arm. "Hmm? Are you hiding?" Nottie turned her gaze to beneath the bed. Under which she found... A dog. It was trembling uncontrollably, probably frightened by the python a moment before. "Oh, what a pity. I wanted to turn you into a wolf, but it seems you turned into a dog instead!" Although Nottie's words seemed to be apologizing, her voice lacked any hint of remorse. Dietrich still hadn't realized what happened yet. It was only by pure instinct that he had scurried under the bed. Only then did he begin to come to his senses. He tried to say something after hearing Nottie's words, but no matter how hard he tried, only "woof woof woof" would come out. After hearing himself, Dietrich panicked and dashed out from under the bed. No matter how many times Dietrich leaped in front of the mirror, or how many times he howled in disbelief, the reflection of a striking young noble never appeared again. Dietrich then turned with a snarl and leaped towards Nottie. Without even being the least bit startled, she simply glanced at him with folded arms. Suddenly Dietrich could no longer move toward her, no matter how hard he tried. "That's not the proper etiquette for addressing a lady. Hmm... It seems you need to be trained!" Vol. 5 "Be a good dog! Yes, there's no reward for getting it right, but there's still a punishment for getting it wrong!" The witch in black makeup smirked. "Allow me to introduce myself again. I am Nottfriga, but perhaps you're more familiar with my nickname. People call me the Enchantress of the Night." As she spoke, her long golden hair began to gradually darken, eventually turning black as the night sky outside the window. Her once sky-blue eyes were now pitch-black, ushering in the darkness of night. "I am your master now. Of course, I will need to train you well." Nottfriga knelt down and placed a necklace that seemingly appeared out of nowhere on the still struggling Dietrich. The necklace shrank in size until it fit perfectly around his furry neck. No matter how he thrashed head about or clawed at it, the necklace would not budge. "Tsk. We've already wasted so much time. Come, we're leaving." With that, Nottfriga set off towards the city. Dietrich whimpered along the way with all the strength he could muster, wishing he could simply run back to his villa. But he couldn't, no matter how hard he tried. The necklace Nottfriga had placed on him seemed to control him, so he had no choice but to follow behind her. Nottfriga glanced back at the reluctant Dietrich dawdling behind her, and curled a strand of hair around her finger. "Although it is certainly amusing to watch you struggle in your current state, you are much too noisy. So unless you'd like a taste of my new Silence of the Night spell, you'd better keep your yapping mouth shut." The whole world seemed to fall into silence at that moment. Intuition told Dietrich that it'd be best not to become the latest test subject for Nottfriga's new spell. Vol. 6 Sometimes, feelings are like the summer rain, coming out of nowhere and catching you unprepared. A nostalgic summer story set in the age of aristocrats begins right here. Dietrich witnessed the fall of the house of Lawrence. Who knew where Mother's kitty had gone. His father, driven to distraction, and his mother, hysterical, were so close by, and yet no matter how he shouted, they did not pay him any heed. "Arf..." Dietrich lowered his head, but before he could speak again, the ground opened up beneath him. A pair of old crone's hands stretched out from the ground, seizing him by the neck. Then he fell, and his fall seemed not to end, till at last he crashed to earth at the feet of the old witch. Strangely, it hurt not at all. Something hooked onto Dietrich's necklace, and he found himself hoisted up bodily. All before him was darkness, and he could only see one thing — that which was below him. It was a steaming pot, filled with some unknown black substance that gurgled and belched. There were some solids in there, too, and when he looked, he could espy spiderwebs and the bones of venomous vipers... Into his ear crept Nottfriga's voice: "Ah, I have you now, my last ingredient. Once I've put you in, my stew of life eternal shall be complete. Hahaha!" "Woof! Woof! Woof!" Let me go, you dastardly witch! Dietrich struggled with all his might, not thinking for a moment that the bond of the hitherto inescapable necklace would suddenly be so easily slipped — "Ar — " And so he fell... He heard nothing more, naught else but the howling wind and Nottfriga's crazed laughter whipping about his ears. Vol. 7 Sometimes, feelings are like the summer rain, coming out of nowhere and catching you unprepared. A nostalgic summer story set in the age of aristocrats begins right here. "Wake up—" Dietrich felt his body being rocked gently. "Are you alright?" A hand reached over as if to check his breathing. It was a familiar voice... Gentle as the April breeze, and genial as the March sun. Dietrich forced his eyes open, and before them— Was the golden-haired, blue-eyed girl. "Ah, wonderful, you're finally awake," she said with a smile. "This place...Is this... Celestia?" Dietrich wondered. "No, I'm afraid it's just an ordinary forest," the girl replied. Then Dietrich's senses returned to him, and he knew then the young lady before him was the source of all his troubles — the wicked old witch, Nottfriga! In a flash, he had recovered, and leaping a distance away from her he maintained a guarded stance. "Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you. Ah, I must've forgotten to introduce myself. My name is Magdalene. I'm, well, Nottfriga's younger sister." So saying, Magdalene gave the finger behind her back a twirl — a calming spell of light magic, and she approached Dietrich. "Come now, it's alright." At this did Dietrich indeed calm down. He desired to ask the girl before him how she could understand him — but he could still do naught but bark. "Oh, this? It is but a small spell. My sister knows it too." "Woof, woof, woof!?" So that crone did hear what I said, and simply pretended not to so she might string me along!? "Well... Still, Nottfriga is actually a gentle person." And speaking of her sister, Magdalene smiled gorgeously once more. "..." Vol. 8 Sometimes, feelings are like the summer rain, coming out of nowhere and catching you unprepared. A nostalgic summer story set in the age of aristocrats begins right here. "Do witches trade their brains for mighty magic? I can't get through to her at all..." Dietrich thought to himself as he followed the golden-haired maiden, who rambled on about something or another. "Ah, don't say that! If my sister heard you, she would be most angry." Magdalene said this in a quiet voice as she looked at Dietrich. "Woof, woof, woof, woof?" Well, you needn't tell her, do you... Wait, how did you know what I was thinking? "Ah... But. It. Is. Too. Late. Now." Dietrich lifted his head in alarm at the rising pressure above him— Her expression had not changed at all... But even so... He knew that the girl before him was now changed. "It seems that your nightmare has been of some use — for your memory, at least. But as I see it, you are still far from adequate." That proud, cold voice from on high — yes, surely this was Nottfriga. "well then, I suppose I shall leave the Essence of the Inmost Heart inside you." What on earth was the "Essence of the Inmost Heart"... Wait, no. Magdalene had mentioned just such a thing. "Don't worry! The nightmare from before was a falsehood. My sister placed the Essence of the Inmost Heart into you, and it can see your fears. That is why you dreamed of the things you fear most." "But I think that my sister must've done it for your good. She is, after all, a most gentle soul." ... Dietrich's fur stood on end, and he trembled as he peeked at Nottfriga, banishing any other thoughts from his mind. "Hah, it seems that my teachings have been quite useful indeed. Well then, let us be on our way." Dietrich's frightened appearance pleased his master, the witch. Vol. 9 "What does the death of a warm spring day feel like?" So the young maiden said one morning, in defiance of all common logic. "I suppose it must feel... furry?" At this moment, Magdalene was clutching a dog — indeed, this was Dietrich — as she kept up a leisurely pace. The golden-haired maiden traipsed upon the gnarled roots of massive trees like an elegant swan, lithely making her way through the woods. "How fortunate that she is currently Magdalene. If it were that hag Nottfriga, she would certainly make me walk or use some sort of magic to force me to run. This path is not made for dogs — no, not even humans could traverse it. There isn't even a road, only trees... Ah, it would be nice if Magdalene could keep carrying me like this..." Dietrich's thoughts meandered as he turned to look at Magdalene. The morning light danced upon her face. She possessed a beauty that could not be considered lesser than any noblewoman's. Her light complexion and gentle expression made her seem delicate, like the short-lived morning dew born upon on flower petals. "Magdalene's skin is so fair... I daresay none of the nobles I've met can compare to her," Dietrich thought as he gazed upon the girl. "Let me tell you a story. That is, I'm already dead," Magdalene suddenly spoke. Vol. 10 After all, none can live and still obtain release. A long time ago, there was a witch who gave birth to twin daughters. However, witches are unable to keep two offspring from the same generation. That is the price they pay, the cost of their enormous power. But this witch had already reached the apex of mastery in dark magic. She offered her own life force to preserve the life of her twins. Still, this solution could not last forever, and as the last of the witch's life force faded, the day of their fated farewell arrived at last. In death, the witch was finally freed from the world. The surviving elder sister, Nottfriga, inherited everything, and felt entirely responsible for the passing of her younger sister, Magdalene. Luckily for Nottfriga, she inherited the witch's talent for dark magic. Using herself as a vessel, she summoned Magdalene's soul using complicated magical symbols and obscure incantations. Then, she read all of the leather-bound books in the tower, and combining what she learned with dark magic and alchemy, created a new vessel. However, the ability to place her sister's soul inside the vessel and bring her back to life was not only a forbidden art in light magic, it was also exceptionally difficult — especially for Nottfriga, who knew no light magic whatsoever. Nevertheless, Nottfriga's insistence on bringing Magdalene back spurred her on, and eventually she found a solution. She transformed the vessel into a serpent bracelet that she wore on her wrist, and set out on an adventure. "My beloved sister, when this is all over, we will never be apart again..." Vol. 11 "I should just stuff that noisy puppy yapper of yours..." "Woof, woof!" That day, the young maiden gave her loyal dog something precious... The last ray of light was fading, and darkness was about to engulf the forest. "It's time to switch, my dear elder sister." Suddenly, Magdalene put down Dietrich, whom she had been holding in her arms. "One last thing, elder sister-I have a present for you. I hope you like it." With this, light slowly began to shine from her fingers, gradually forming a dazzling ball of light. This was Magdalene's light magic. "Alright, from now on, you have to be well behaved. Shh, don't say anything." "What? Why are you being so mysterious... Ugh." Before Dietrich could react, he had quietly muttered something, but his speech was interrupted when he suddenly found a slender hand tightly covering his mouth. A moment later, the girl — now transformed — hastily stuffed something into his mouth. "What's this..." It was the hilt of Dietrich's sword. The sword that once proudly hung from his belt. "!?" Dietrich opened his mouth instinctively to say something. "Bite down on it if you want to live." Nottfriga raised one hand into the air, and Dietrich felt unable to breathe as the collar around his neck grew tighter and tighter. Powerless to resist, it was all he could do to bite down as instructed. "Listen carefully. In a moment, you will need to defend yourself with this sword. Even though you're an ignorant and useless spoiled brat, it would still be a lot of trouble for me if you died here." Nottfriga raised Dietrich's head and spoke in a low voice. "After all, I haven't finished teaching you a lesson yet. It would ruin my fun if you died too easily." The witch of the night finished speaking, and retracted her hand to adjust her garments. The collar loosened again, returning to normal tightness. At once, air rushed passed his teeth and in through his nostrils, filling up his lungs again. Dietrich still did not dare relax his jaw's grip on the sword, however, so he had to make do with somewhat impaired breathing. Before long, the sound of commotion was heard in the distance...A fairytale story that has been told throughout Teyvat for ages. This is part one, which tells the story of the Land of Night and the Moonlight Forest. In the distant past, the Night Mother ruled over the faraway Land of Night. Here, no light touched the earth, nor did a single tree grow, and there was no life here but the horrendous denizens of the dark. The Night Mother was the source of all sins, and the Land of Night was the embodiment of her evilness. The cruel Night Mother, who had neither heart nor mouth, was always watching the Land of Night, and her punishments were always unexpected. The only thing she could not bear was the occasional ray of moonlight that made it through the clouds. The light that penetrated the walls of darkness always irritated her. The Moonlight Forest was the only place free from the rule of the Night Mother. Only there could the people bask in the bright moonlight and enjoy the grace it brought to the living. Everyone in the Kingdom of the Moonlight Forest was born with fair skin, light-colored hair, and bright blue eyes. Perhaps the constant lack of sunlight and the nourishment of the moonlight was the reason for their beauty, giving them an appearance different from the abhorrent creatures lurking at the edge of the forest.

Notes xe2x86x91 A similar situation occurs with the book Before Sun and Moon , which contains an account of the world's history starting with the Heavenly Principles ' arrival. Abyss Order member Enjou tries and fails to find it during the World Quest The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent in Series From Dusk to Dawn in Byakuyakoku , while Khaenri'ah 's attempt to steal it some two thousand years prior was foiled.A popular martial arts novel in Liyue Harbor. In a world without elemental energy or alchemy, a tale unfolds of love and hate between friends and foes. This volume tells of the origins of Jin the Seventy-Second's revenge. A single sword's light pierced the night air, unchallenged by any star or moon. The autumn wind in the mountains wept aloud, following the whirling dance of the lonesome blade. Driving wind and falling rain accompanied a single traveler on his solitary journey. This person's hair was wild, and his face fierce, and he seemed most fey indeed. His clothes were thin, and he swayed this way and that in the center of the homeward path like one sick or hurt to the quick, seeming more like some ghoul than a living man. He had been on the path three days. Three days he had gone hungry, and without any sleep. Three days ago, he had a name and a famed sword, and his fallen martial arts school. But now, he only wore sorrow and worry on his brow, which rolled off him, carried by the sudden rain, and onto the mud below, eroding the soil. Three days ago, that nameless swordsman had started a feud with him, a feud that saw his master and junior buried in the merciless mountain snow as the screaming snow was stained red. Today, he had a new name — Jin the Seventy-Second. For he was the last of the 72 members of their school. — He did not know how long he had walked before he heard the sound of carts behind him. Jin the Seventy-Second shuffled to the side of the road and stopped, asking: "Is your cart headed for Tupi Village?" The cart driver saluted him and replied: "Few of the carts on this road do not do so." Jin the Seventy-Second then asked: "Then pray will your cart bear another man?" The cart driver said: "It could, but you did not ask if I would." Jin the Seventy-Second did not understand. "If you travel to Tupi Village, why would you not take me?" "For you are not I, nor I, you," the driver replied. "What a waste of words." And no sooner had that been said than the blade left its sheath. The cart driver felt but a single chilling cold, and fell from his cart to the floor without a struggle, never to speak again. Jin the Seventy-Second was just such a person. Though he had lost everything, even his heart, and his bold brashness had ebbed, he had always hated pointlessly talkative people most of all. Riding the bloodstained cart, Jin the Seventy-Second departed for Tupi Village. Vol. 2 A popular martial arts novel in Liyue Harbor. In a world without elemental energy or alchemy, a tale unfolds of love and hate between friends and foes. This volume tells of Jin the Seventy-Second's arrival in Tupi Village. They say that in that faraway land, "Tupi" meant to burn away vanity's dross to attain the gem of truth. Tupi Village lay at the foot of a barren mountain, passable to the outside world only by a single ancient path — the very same that lay beneath Jin the Seventy-Second's feet. The skies were darkening, and the wind and rain howled. Jin the Seventy-Second had never had anything to do with Tupi Village, but for his vengeance, and so he now sought out its village chief. By the time the oxcart had finally trudged its way through the muddy old road to the mountain's base, it was fully night, and gloomy clouds cast a boundless shadow as they covered the moon's eyes. Jin the Seventy-Second hid in that shade, drinking the night in, body and soul. In that deep night, the pure white light of the moon shone upon the head of the village chief. Tupi Village had never been large, but the chief was no ordinary character. No one knew his name or his past, and no one dared to ask. They only knew that his shoulders bore a great blood debt, from a past as crimson as his eyes. For red they were, and sharp, like a blade, piercing the hearts of all he gazed upon as he pleased. His character was much the same, like a sharp knife that might pierce another person's heart at any time without forewarning. "It's time." The chief shook his head as he talked to himself, the cold moonlight dancing over his shaven crown. Outside, a ravenous demon wielded a blood-letting long sword, massacring his followers one after the other. Though Tupi Village was full of evil people, schools and sects had their rules, and so none would dare come knocking with rash provocations and talk of revenge. But Jin the Seventy-Second had no school or sect, and was thus unbound by any such rules. He was but a single starving ghost with a lone sharp blade, yearning to taste the blood of his enemies. The wind and rain accompanied the din of battle, and the downpour washed away the crimson that stained the swordsman, only for another layer to be painted on immediately... The crimson swordsman strode forward amid a crimson mist. Many were his wounds, but none could stay his hand. When that mist had at last cleared in the endless deluge, the swordsman crossed the turbid red beneath his feet, and stalked towards the chief's mansion. — The din beyond the gates quieted, and only now did the chief raise a cup of wine, and scatter the alcohol into the air with a flick. Perhaps to toast the fated meeting to come, or as a ritual for his sullied soul. The doors opened. It was Jin the Seventy-Second, his reddened outline juxtaposed against the blinding gray elements outside. "I have questions for you, village chief." "You've taken quite a few of my men's lives." "Exactly three hundred and sixty-two. No more, no less..." The chief spoke naught, and his face remained still, but the pulsing vein in his temple betrayed the fire within. "...Ah yes, and one dog." So saying, the crimson silhouette tossed a certain object forward. It clattered atop the wind case... ...And it was the bone of the dog that guarded the door. It had been stewed for a time, and was picked clean almost to the marrow. For in this half an hour, not only had Jin the Seventy-Second snuffed out the lives of three hundred and sixty-two able men, but he had even turned the dog keeping the gate into dog meat stew. What cruelty. What ruthlessness! The village chief let out a terrible scream, and standing, he drew his sword— Vol. 3 A popular martial arts novel in Liyue Harbor. In a world without elemental energy or alchemy, a tale unfolds of love and hate between friends and foes. This volume tells of Jin the Seventy-Second's duel with the chief of Tupi Village. The rain had ceased, but light had yet to recoup the skies. Jin the Seventy-Second had obtained news of his nemesis from the mouth of the village chief. Now, not a thing was left in Tupi Village but masterless rooms, and masterless spirits. And not even that remained, for this was a world without spirits. This world possessed no elemental power, And so, the memories of the dead could not remain in the mortal realm via elemental resonance. The village chief was a formidable foe. His blade was as swift as could be, and he had left many wounds on Jin the Seventy-Second, each deep enough to cut bone. But alas, his "heart" was far too slow. For this was a world without elements, And thus swordsmanship could not be imbued with them. Swordsmanship was thus a question of pure physical skill and not elemental control. The sword is an extension of one's body, and one uses it as an arm would command the fingers, or as one's heart directs the eyes. Though he was skilled indeed in the art of the swift blade, the village chief never understood the value of the "heart," and so he fell to a single stroke. Jin the Seventy-Second strode towards the fallen chief, discarding the broken incense burner in his left hand. For the chief had focused too narrowly on pouring savage strokes upon the swordsman's body, thinking them too harried to fight back, and had no eyes for his enemy's left hand, which should have been empty— —And in a flash, the incense burner had struck the chief of Tupi Village on the forehead, sending him tumbling into a wall where he then collapsed, immobile. "Underhanded villain..." But only the wind answered him — the villain gripping the bloodied censor said not a word. "...The person you're looking for is in the barren mountains beyond this village... Go seek your death there..." But the villain had departed, and all that remained to answer him was the rustling the wind... And the crackling of wild flames. Vol. 4 A popular martial arts novel in Liyue Harbor. In a world without elemental energy or alchemy, a tale unfolds of love and hate between friends and foes. This volume tells of Jin the Seventy-Second's treacherous trek into the mountains. Jin the Seventy-Second waited till the rainbow had dispersed before setting off once from Tupi Village toward the barren mountains. Ancient legend held that these batten mountains had been brought into being by slices from the Celestial Emperor's blade, and thus were incredibly hard to scale. Folk tales also held that they were called barren, for they had soaked up the tears of the Earth Mother, and thus had become bitterly salty lands where nothing grew. The barren mountains had once been mined for gold and gems, but the mines had all been ruined in an earthquake, their workers buried within. No one tried ever again to create the facilities to mine the mountain's bounty, and its caverns were infested with wicked beasts and bandits. And among these evils hidden in the mountains was Jin the Seventy-Second's nemesis. The swordsman's shoulders shivered, and his gait was hesitant, for the wounds he had been given in the battle against the chief of Tupi Village hindered him still. He knew that many pairs of eyes stared out at him from between the wither rocks, and the breath of beasts who had caught the scents of hid blood was all around. Long years of bloodshed had honed Jin the Seventy-Second's senses to their limit. He sensed that the lifeless mountains were in fact a giant death trap. Bandits and villains lay in wait for him to enter some narrow grotto, or squeeze into a tiny gorge, or pass by a collapsed mine shaft. Then, they would set upon him in the darkness with knives, and finish him. But from the looks of things now, the steep mountains now looked like they might be able to kill Jin the Seventy-Second. The swordsman limped with every step he took, and the road was small and treacherous. Every so often, gravel would slip loose beneath his feet. At the same time, upon a cliff twisted about with sinuous, dead trees, two figures squinted as they observed the tiny wanderer. "He has been worse for wear since he departed from the mountain's base. If we but leave him to the treacherous trek, he will surely fall into the abyss below." So said a bone-thin old crone. She glanced to her side, icy death in her jade-blue eyes, sharp as a viper hidden in a rocky cleft. "Not so!" She turned to face the booming voice of a corpulent old man. "He slew three hundred and sixty-two at Tupi Village, and even cooked the dog at the gate for stew. "Though he may have been badly wounded by the village chief to the point where he can barely move, we should still beware of him." "Hmph..." The old woman vanished into the withered forest with a displeased noise. "..." The old man watched a while longer as the lame swordsman stopped for a moment more, before patting his large belly and slowly departed. Not a single withered tree or blade of dying grass was touched as he did. Then suddenly the sky turned dark with gathering stormclouds, and mordant rain again began to fall lightly. In the mountain rain, the wounded Jin the Seventy-Second leaned on his sword like a crutch, and struggled forward. But the chilling cold and the loss of blood was too much for him to bear, and he fell upon the gravel and barren stone. Just as the darkness took him, he caught a glimpse of the billowing hem of azure-blue skirts... He could've sworn he'd seen that sight before.

about memories are always closely intertwined with transience. This book is not all-new, but is an adaptation of " Urakusai 's Chronicles of the Six Kitsune." Prologue Stories relating to memory always seem to have to do with those moments where you gain something and lose it straight away. If you're wondering how I came to write about it, it's hardly the most exciting story. That night, I was drinking and killing time at the Uyuu Restaurant when I happened to run into an old friend that I hadn't seen in forever. I don't know when she arrived, but at some point I suddenly noticed her sitting there in one of the booths. "My, my, now, who could this be, sitting there in such a good mood, yet drinking all alone?" Since she was asking, I thought I might as well mutter something in response: "The best liquor comes at the highest price, and sometimes that price is waiting alone." "Pff, I've definitely heard that one before... Still as boring as ever, I see." Thus remarked the chief editor as she stood there with a liquor cup in hand, looking very enthusiastic about the prospect of having a drink or two. "Why not earn yourself some drinking money? It's not like you've got anything better to do." "Tonight, though, the drinks are on me." She laughed, and reiterated this a couple more times. "You're back." I watched as the evening breeze brought a few flower petals from the Sacred Sakura and landed them in her cup, making ripples that disturbed the reflection of the moon. Overcome by a strong sense of dxc3xa9jxc3xa0 vu, my mouth took it upon itself to proceed with an utterance that would prove to be something of an embarrassment to my brain. "You're drunk." She didn't look very happy to hear that, and retorted with a firm and defiant tone in her voice. But her countenance quickly changed again as she placed her cup down on the table and let out a sigh: "I wasn't even born yet when she left." And I was still in my youth back then. "You must be the only one still able to recite the stories she once told." And just like that, I found myself roped into writing for the Yae Publishing House one more time. It's quite amusing, now I think about it. To my faithful readers, please don't be upset. This should not be taken to mean that I am committed to no longer writing save for when it becomes a selfish indulgence. After all, there's some great liquor that's soon to decrease in price, and I have to make sure I'm prepared. Besides, I have to pay the chief editor back for the wine she so kindly bought me that night. Vol. 2 The story of the "Black Fox" Itaru was actually the third volume in the original "Urakusai's Chronicles of the Six Kitsune." It appears at the front of this edition due to the writer's personal preference. Forgive my garrulousness, but there are still some things to get out of the way before the story begins in earnest. Why the "new" chronicles of the six kitsune? Naturally, the word "new" here presumes the existence of an "old." This book is a slightly revised edition of Urakusai's Chronicles of the Six Kitsune, which enjoyed a period of great popularity five hundred years ago. I possess but limited writing skills, and can only hope that Urakusai and my other readers will peruse these pages with forgiving eyes. Urakusai was already famous when I was but a small child. By that time, the Saiguu had already taken great interest in Urakusai's literary abilities and expertise on tea, making Urakusai one of the most cultured and sophisticated of all the kitsune. Unfortunately, that is all in the past now. Urakusai made a grave mistake and had to leave. It has now been 500 years since then... Without further ado, the story of the New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune begins on the towering Mt. Yougou . Legend has it that in the time of the Great Kitsune Hakushin , she had six apprentices. All were greatly skilled in magic and in shape-shifting. Day-to-day, they were tasked with assisting their matriarch, Hakushin, in managing the shrine and defending Mt. Yougou. The eldest of the six was Itaru the Black Fox, who, unlike most other females, was built as broad as a bear and as strong as a tiger. She also had a wild and unruly personality. One day, she was being drunk and disorderly in the main hall of the shrine, and destroyed a shintai that represented the Shogun. Incensed, Hakushin banished Itaru from the mountain for a period of much-needed self-reflection. But Black Fox Itaru was all too happy to leave the mountain behind. She put Hakushin's warnings completely out of her mind, found a bottle of good-quality liquor, and headed straight for the nearest village to look for trouble. Vol. 3 This volume recounts the clash between "Black Fox Itaru" and the " Twin Oni of Tokaku ." This tale was missing from the original text, but it was fortunately rediscovered at a later date. It is presented here in an edited form. Continuing where we left off, Black Fox Itaru was on her way to the village looking for trouble when she saw two women standing at the side of the road dressed like lumberjacks. Both had three blades hanging from their waist: a seven-foot-long nodachi, a kodachi, and a wakizashi. They were armed to the teeth, and they weren't hiding it. As her big, bulky silhouette approached from a distance, the ground shook and dust went flying with each step she took — all of which put the two women on high alert. They grasped the hilts of their blades, ready to draw them at any moment, and asked in unison: "Who are you? Are you a youkai !?" The silhouette answered: "Haha, that's exactly what I am!" Without hesitation, the two women immediately drew their swords and stepped forward, intending to slay Itaru. But this was one youkai they had underestimated. She dodged their attacks in a single step, grabbed their wrists, and twisted them as she turned sideways, sending both of their seven-foot-long nodachi clattering to the ground. Alarmed by the pain, the two reached for their kodachi, but they were too late. Itaru sent one of them flying to the ground with an almighty slap, while placing the other into a headlock. Then, she grabbed the one under her arm by the scruff of the neck and lifted her up into the air, placing her foot on the other's chest to pin her to the ground. "The Twin Oni of Tokaku? Looks like neither of you have learned anything from the beating I gave you last year for harassing the villagers!" When the two bandits heard this, they panicked and started begging for their lives. Black Fox Itaru threw them to the ground and begin to speak: "Fair enough. Well, I'm a masterless youkai now that I've been banished from the mountain by Hakushin. Why don't the two of you join me? We'll go around helping those in need. It'll be fun!" Vol. 4 In the 500-year-old "Urakusai's Chronicles of the Six Kitsune," Youzan and Yui went on to have their own tales. But at this time, the mother-daughter pair are still reliant on Itaru to rescue them. Continuing where we left off, Black Fox Itaru successfully tamed the bandit duo, the Twin Oni of Tokaku, and the three set off on their new journey of chivalry. As the chivalric trio was resting in Konda Village , they ran into a mother and her daughter. After striking up a conversation, they learned that the mother's surname was Youzan, the daughter's given name was Yui, and that both were musicians from the distant Seirai Island visiting Inazuma City to join in the festival. On their way, they had been scammed by a Lavender Melon seller from the village: He had offered them a few melons to quench their thirst, ostensibly out of the goodness of his heart, before then insisting that they purchase more of his melons at an extortionate price. But touring musicians aren't exactly wealthy, and they couldn't afford to spend the entirety of their budget for the return trip on overpriced melons... The Twin Oni of Tokaku are an impulsive pair. Upon hearing the story, they instantly began fuming with rage, and unanimously decided that they needed to teach this dishonest merchant a lesson by cutting him into tiny pieces. But Black Fox Itaru had another idea, and spoke up to stop the two sisters: "Enough. I know what to do." She comforted the mother and daughter: "You two have nothing to worry about. Just watch, I'll talk to the merchant, and he'll come to his senses." Itaru marched off to look for the dishonest merchant. Vol. 5 This is the tensest tale of the series, said to have been written by Urakusai upon his return from Liyue . It is featured in full in this writer's adaptation. Continuing where we left off, Black Fox Itaru marched off to talk some sense into the dishonest merchant. The Lavender Melon merchant, Dozaemon, was once a samurai. But with peace having prevailed in Inazuma for so long, his sword skills offered no further use, so he became a merchant in the village instead. After learning a few swindler's tricks, such as extortion and intimidation, he found that because he looked so fierce, no one dared confront him no matter how much he took from them. Over time, he had become one of the wealthiest people in the village. On this day, Dozaemon was relaxing in front of his shop when all of a sudden, he saw dust flying and felt the ground shaking. Then, a shadow large enough to dwarf his shop slowly fell over his face. "Hey! I want to buy some melons!" Dozaemon narrowed his eyes and sized up the muscular, fierce-looking, and ill-mannered customer standing over him like an executioner, before finally realizing — oh, she's a woman...! "How many?" Apparently, this customer was in no hurry to answer. She was too busy admiring his wakizashi, which was lying on the chopping board: "Mighty fine blade you got there." "You got that right. I'll have you know I'm from a samurai clan. It's only fitting that I keep an heirloom nearby." Dozaemon went along with the conversation, unaware of where it was heading. "Shame. It's wasted on chopping melons." Dozaemon sensed that this was an intentionally barbed remark, and he did not look happy about it: "What's with all the chit-chat? Are you buying melons or not?" "Oh, I am, I am." Itaru smiled at Dozaemon as a gesture of apology. "Four pounds of chopped Lavender Melon, without the skins, please." Dozaemon's suspicions were aroused, but he did not question the request. He promptly chopped four pounds of melon and placed it onto the scale. "Hey, how come your scale's all wonky?" Dozaemon grasped his blade the moment Itaru said this. "Well, isn't that something—this scale's got a mind of its own!" "Glad you're so amused. But it's time to pay up now." Dozaemon could no longer hold back his anger. The time for pleasantries was over it was time to talk sense. "Heh, I don't have a problem with paying you what you're due... I'm just not sure you'd be able to take it." "Oh, don't you worry — I'll take whatever you've got to give!" "You sure about that!?" "Try me!" Suddenly, Itaru yelled "take this!" and threw a bag full of Mora directly at Dozaemon's face. Dozaemon didn't react in time, and took the full force of the impact square on the nose. He fell backwards onto the ground as his precious wakizashi went flying from his hand and fell beside him. On closer inspection, his nose had been squashed completely flat by the bag of Mora: It looked just like the kind of pouch one might use to store a pipe, only without the pipe inside. Itaru walked over and pressed her foot down on the dishonest merchant's chest. Without a word, she hit Dozaemon so hard it felt like a Liyue martial arts tournament was being hosted on his face. With great difficulty, he fought to get back on his feet, but just as he had stood up and grabbed his blade, Itaru noticed and landed another ferocious blow to his head. This time, it hit so hard that a pair of tanuki ears popped out in response. He began to beg for mercy. Itaru burst out laughing at the sight in front of her. So, the merchant is a youkai in disguise and a filthy tanuki at that! Itaru promptly confiscated the tanuki's stolen wakizashi, distributed most of its ill-gotten wealth among the villagers, and handed the rest to the mother and daughter who had fallen victim to its scheme earlier. Itaru spared the tanuki's life albeit not without some reluctance and continued on her way. Vol. 6 Commentary regarding ancient matters that was specially added to the "New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune." If you find it an insipid, monotonous slog, dear reader, you may skip this volume. But as far as the author is concerned, this is one waste of words and emotion that cannot be avoided. We shall bring the anecdotes of Black Fox Itaru to a close for now. Please forgive me for nagging, but I have some old matters I wish to comment on. Now, it is no longer well-known how exactly Urakusai angered Lady Saiguu at that time. However, Lady Yae did offer to tell me some snippets of the history she experienced after having between two and eight drinks. This is a novel, of course, so I naturally would like to turn these words into a story of what history has not recorded. When the Kitsune Saiguu departed from the Hakushin Lands to take up her post at the Grand Narukami Shrine , Lady Yae still had yet to be born. As such, her early years were filled with stories and tales about Saiguu, and she loved and respected her greatly. This is also why Lady Yae would eventually come to the Grand Narukami Shrine herself after embarking on her own travels. Due to their closeness by blood, Lady Saiguu doted upon Lady Yae quite a bit, though Lady Yae speaks as little as possible about those times as she may nowadays... —And while I as a novelist write to entertain, I shall refrain from revealing too much about Lady Yae's past, lest I suffer under the editor-in-chief's mighty pen. But back to Urakusai. It is no longer clear how Urakusai angered Lady Saiguu back in the day, but it is known that his deeds may have had some connection to the later incursion of the Abyss . &#91; Note 1 &#93; However, after Urakusai had been driven out, the Kitsune Saiguu would no longer dwell at the Grand Narukami Shrine, but would instead set up permanent residence at Tenshukaku . "A disaster that will engulf heaven and earth is coming. My duty is to defend the people and protect our lord, and so I must go to the Shogun's side." When Lady Saiguu departed the second time, Lady Yae was but a young girl. The person she had pursued all this time now left her again. It was not until the untimely disaster swept across the archipelago that we understood the meaning of Lady Saiguu's words... But it was too late, and things had not turned out as we would have wished. This time, Lady Saiguu left a third time. This time, she departed forever. Five centuries may seem long to mortals, but the joys and sorrows left by the things that happened during that time, whether to fleeting existences or enduring ones, are not easy to erase.Amid a sea of stars that spin in reverse, light-centuries of war unfold down on the planet's surface... With this grandiose opening comes an all-new tale of gallantry! "Even if Emperor Sher's ambitions are realized, how will anybody benefit from it?" Secretary of Defense Faranges stared out of the window into space as the galaxies and stars shone gently upon her face, their pale white glow flowing softly and slowly down each strand of her hair. She couldn't help but think back to the first time she looked out at this ocean of stars through this very window. But she no longer remembered the sense of awe she felt back then. Even her homeland, now hundreds of light-years away, had long since become faded and distorted in her memories whenever they surfaced in her dreams. "Forgive me for speaking out of place, Your Highness, but this war has been dragging on for far too long. We've battled through countless constellations, wiped out tens of millions of lives in all sorts of devious ways, and made ourselves viceroys and envoys of every obscure constellation we came across, all in an effort to make Emperor Sher's dreams a reality. But what has His grand vision brought us? One misfortune after another, and an ever-growing number of enemies. They're in every corner of the galaxy now... it's just a matter of time before they swallow us up!" "My brother's vision is for an empire that will rule for all eternity, one where there is no fear, and where people do not lack for anything. The fate of the many will no longer be dictated by the few, no one will enjoy a higher status than anybody else, and even incompetence will no longer be seen as a crime. And so... it is inevitable that those who cannot comprehend this grand vision are doomed to be swept aside. This is their fate." Princess Gopatha shook her head and spoke with a gentle yet cold tone. It seemed as if the Intergalactic Anti-Guerrilla War had robbed her of more than just one of her eyes and one of her arms, because when Faranges looked at her, she did not see the joyful young woman she once knew. "I trust in brother's decision — he would not act out of mere self-interest. So please, even though it is you, don't say such things again in the future. Don't speak words that sow doubt." Vol. 2 Amid a sea of stars that spin in reverse, no battle is legendary enough to be any more than a ripple in the silence for those who dwell upon the shore... But for the warriors in the thick of it, the war is all there is. Surely, even an armada consisting entirely of Yazata-class warships would have a tough job making a dent in a defense as watertight as this one. Admiral Geldafried's overconfidence in the greatest technological marvel of the empire meant that she was completely unaware that the rebels were, at that very moment, closing in on the fatal weakness of their base. The mighty Star Fortress, Anusharwan — designed personally by Princess Gopatha, and named by Emperor Sher — was now nothing more than a fragile egg before the rebel fleet, and mother hen was away from the nest. Bastinu deftly navigated the Lachsz Clipper through the intricate and winding ventilation system, weaving between jets of poisonous gas and elemental clouds shooting out from holes in the walls, while trying to shake the automatic mechanical sentries on his tail. His eyes and ears filled with blood and the scene before him merged into a continuous blur of color and light as the clipper shot ahead at a breathtaking speed. "Now's my chance." So thought Bastinu to himself as the propulsion system's energy core came gradually into view. "It's time." So thought Admiral Geldafried to herself as she gazed at the flashing sphere of light in the planet's orbit. Then, she gave the order to launch an indiscriminate assault on the planet. Then, Bastinu launched a fatal attack on the fortress core. "Oh, what I would give to see the look on Princess Gopatha's face right now..." So thought both to themselves, separately but identically, in that brief moment. Vol. 3 Amid a sea of stars that spin in reverse lies a small chain of shattered isles, each of which has its own history, featuring tales heroic and trivial alike. This heroic tale is set in the time of the Suruga Shogunate. Ten years earlier... 25 light years away... With the nation under the rule of the Suruga Shogunate, cries of anguish filled the streets as the people suffered bitterly. At that time, the Suruga Shogunate was led by the Seii Tai-Shogun, Imagawa Ujizane. Four years prior, after finally beheading Demon King Danjouchuu, the Tai-Shogun's own reign of terror began. It was in this time and place that our free and unrestrained swordmaster wandered the land. His name was Bitchuu Kyuubei, and he was known to the people as Shinkurou, the vigilante. Bitchuu Kyuubei was not a ronin as such. It is said that he was once the most trusted strategist for His Excellency the Tai-Shogun, until one day he was framed by a rival. Given the Shogun's paranoid nature, this left him with no choice but to flee the Shogunate and escape into the wilderness. Today, Shinkurou was standing on a mountainside gazing into the distance. But what was the object of his gaze? Was it the vast expanse of open fields? No. Was it the mountain range in the distance? No. Was it the road stretching out ahead of him? Yes! Although, that's not the full story. So. What was the object of Shinkurou's gaze, exactly...? The farmers who had paid the swordsman in rice for his services cowered in fear, too afraid to ask. It seems that only the silent swordsman himself knew the answer to this question. Vol. 4 There is a saying in Inazuma: "What are bandits but the children of war?" In times of tumult, even the harvest is a battlefield... See how this unfolds in the latest volume of "A Legend of Sword"! "The fall is here. The season of harvest is almost upon us." The one speaking was Saitou Onisa. Ninjas are dangerous individuals, experts in self-preservation and in avoiding danger. In times of war and upheaval, they work as mercenaries for the Daimyo. They are born in war, and they draw their strength from the powerful masters they work for. Such is the path of the ninja. But it is also the path of the ninja to become displaced and disillusioned at the end of a war, or to meet their ruin as soon as they lose their powerful backing. So when the Imagawa Tai-Shogun finally united the country, the ninjas became like hunting dogs that had outlived their purpose. Most were either executed or drafted into the shogun's army, but some got away, disappeared into the wilderness, and turned to a life of banditry. That is precisely Saitou Onisa's story. "There's no rush. Let's wait for the villagers to finish harvesting the grain for us." The person speaking this time was called Yonemata Tasuke. Bandits are either samurai who have grown weary of the warrior's way or farmers fighting to stay alive. They, too, are born in war. They draw their strength from cunning, and this emboldens them to run amok across across the land. But when war ends and peace is restored, the source of their power evaporates. Like mayflies, they disappear as quickly as they came. Yonemata Tasuke was born into an ordinary farming family, only turning to banditry in his forties. Yet, despite his age, he took to it with great aplomb, and quickly established himself as a ringleader. The most terrible of all bandits are those who have themselves suffered terribly under an oppressive hand. "Then, we burn everything. Leave no survivors." His was the voice of an age of upheaval. Vol. 5 Amid a sea of stars that spin in reverse, in nondescript village in a remote corner of the shattered isles, a ronin who has fallen upon hard times forms an alliance with a group of farmers. A great battle with the bandits draws near... The terrain of Asada Village was shaped like crescent moon. Shinkurou had noticed this the very first time he set foot in the marshland. If he could organize enough villagers to lie in ambush up on the mountain ridge, shielding themselves with the terrain and attacking downwards from the high ground, defeating the enemy would be easy. Especially since the bandits would be weary from their journey. Furthermore, the villagers outnumbered the bandits, so surrounding them on all sides would not be difficult to pull off. But the biggest obstacle to this plan was the villagers themselves. A small group of easy targets would be needed as bait to lure the bandits into the valley, but after enduring an age of despotic rule, only to continue to suffer under the tyrannical and extortionate taxation practices of the present Shogunate, the mentality of individual self-preservation was deeply ingrained. How was he going to convince anybody to volunteer to be the bait and sacrifice themselves for everyone else's benefit? There was one other problem, too. In wartime, a samurai army finding themselves in this situation would be certain to use fire to make their ambush more effective. The wind from the mountain would make the fire spread quickly, trapping the enemy in the valley and dealing them a devastating blow. But this was farming community seeking to keep their land and village safe. There was nothing he could say to convince them that setting their houses and grain reserves on fire was anything close a good idea. This was completely understandable, of course, but the fact was that an even worse fate would await them they fail to take the bandits down. Shinkurou silently sat down and continued to ponder the conundrum. Vol. 6 "In essence, the great battle in space is no different from the armed conflict between commoners which took place ten years ago on that barren planet..." Soon, the name of that man shall be known across the Galaxy, matching that of the Emperor. "Captain, forgive my bluntness, but you were sleeping the whole time during that meeting earlier." "Huh, so you noticed?" "Oh, you were sitting quite upright, but I've seen this happen many times before. Captain, I'd ask you not to use your training as a martial artist in this manner. A written report isn't going to save you if the fleet commander hears of this." So Mahasti said, but in truth, no one had ever dared to touch his superior. Amidst the delicate balance that Allied Fleet Command maintained internally, his middle aged captain and superior, Bitchuu Kyuubei, also known as Shinkurou, now also known as "Semimaru" using some truly lame pronunciation, was the very same person everyone was trying to court to their side, and the one most likely to break this deadlock. This was a whole decade ago now... Shinkurou thought to himself quietly. That one victorious battle at Asada village, on reflection, had been nothing but a minor test of Shinkurou's military prowess. But for the parties involved, this could be called the beginning of the disaster. As expected, the Tai-Shogun would not permit such a talented person to wander in the wild. Not long after, Shinkurou would be blinded in both eyes and thrown in jail. This state of affairs lasted until five years ago, when the Imagawa clan was defeated by an allied army formed under the Oome daimyo clan, beheading its leader in the process. From then, the nation and its people would finally experience a period of peace... That was what the new Seii Tai-Shogun told Shinkurou personally in while the latter was in prison. Shinkurou had never in his life seen the common folk able to work and live in peace, and this strange Tai-Shogun was likely no saint, either. The general amnesty was something that simply had to be done to win the people over. As he reminisced, Shinkurou could not help but sigh: whether in the past or now, people like him would always be at the center of the vortex, whether they liked it or not. "As far as this country is concerned, people like me are traitors, and I suppose that is also the case in this vast universe." The Shogun looked at the sitting Shinkurou and spoke in an indifferent voice. "The Imperial Tax is no longer something that this tiny planet in a corner of the universe can take up. And someone of your ability should be free to flex it among the stars." "Your clan and your given names were taken by that cretin Imagawa, yes, but abandon that past. From now on, you shall be known as 'Semimaru.'" Yes. Someone who no longer had a past, someone whose eyes could no longer behold the many wonders of the universe... Now, its vastness opened before him.They say that in the past, when the fragile and short-lived mortals had yet to cross over the sea unto these lands, Inazuma was once a land that belonged to the tanuki . They say, too, that human history began as drunken tanuki nonsense... Welcome to Toki Alley, a place where history and wild tales intertwine. Prologue: The Tanuki's Oral History of Inazuma They say that in the past, before the fragile and short-lived mortals had crossed over the sea to these lands, Inazuma was once a land that belonged to the tanuki. Lazy and fickle by nature, the tanuki never worried about tomorrow, nor did they carry today's troubles with them through the night. During that period, the land of Inazuma was a cozy paradise for the tanuki and every day was a fun-filled festival. At least, that's what the tanuki elders say. Later on, the kitsune arrived by sea, forcing the tanuki into a great war that lasted first for 800 years and then for another 800 years, with both sides suffering heavy casualties, until eventually the only option was to hold peace talks. The tanuki are a stubborn bunch and to this day still don't admit defeat, but the fact remains that they ceded the giant Thunder Sakura to the kitsune. But the kitsune are a crafty and cunning bunch too, and equally skilled in the art of shape-shifting. It is said that in that great war, as a consequence of the constant switcheroo trickery, many poor souls became completely disoriented and could not for the life of them keep track of who was who — eventually forgetting even who they were, what they were, and which side they were supposed to be on. Thus were the hapless mortals born. The product of bewildered youkai . This tale and many others were told to me by the tengu who likes to boast. Vol. 2 The great tengu are naught but brutal braggarts, and especially when drunk! — Tanuki Historical Commentary Yoichi's Tale The tengu's name is Yoichi , and she lives in Hanamizaka on a small side street called Toki Alley. She rents a shop there that sells alcohol, and lives a leisurely existence. I say "leisurely." That's putting it nicely. "Completely and utterly chaotic" would be a more accurate description. In theory, someone who enjoys alcohol enough to start a business selling it should know a thing or two about it. This applies as much to youkai as to humans. But to be absolutely blunt, Yoichi has terrible taste in alcohol and has no business sense at all. Worst of all, in all her days in the human realm, she has never ridden herself of her awful tengu habits. Sometimes she will get drunk and stir up trouble among other youkai or kidnap human children and parade around all night at the festival, causing total chaos. Other times, she will barge into a theater, with no regard for the atmosphere, then casually strut on stage and start beating up the lead actor... the list goes on. If it weren't for her senior status among the youkai and her extensive connections in human society, I suspect Yoichi might have been dealt with by some hero or other at the foot of a mountain long ago. But the youkai and human folk of Toki Alley see her quite differently. Even the Great Gongen &#91; Note 1 &#93; has never given her serious punishment, because she has never caused any major trouble. Though haughty and slovenly by nature, as a "great youkai, set apart from the common folk" (her own words), Yoichi isn't greatly attached to worldly possessions. Any money she comes into is spent swiftly on alcohol — or else on novels from Yae Publishing House, which she skims through halfway before promptly defenestrating them. As a result, her home is not what you would call "domesticated" — quite the opposite, in fact. Simply put, she doesn't have any worldly possessions of sentimental value... the sole exception being the golden paper fan she wears on her waist. The Great Tengu are a race of youkai that travels to many different worlds, and it's not at all uncommon for them to adorn themselves with battle trophies that have an interesting backstory. Such is the case for this paper fan. On a moonlit night, a drunken Yoichi, her shirt collar wide open, began bragging to me about its story... She said that in one of the many worlds she had traversed, she took the form of a haughty young male archer, serving under an equally haughty shogun. Under that shogun's command, she, — or rather, "he" — had proudly shot down countless opponents, including big-bellied mortal samurai and crafty tanuki ninjas. Even the jikininki, &#91; Note 2 &#93; despite their bulky figures, were no match against a single shot from Yoichi's bow. "Hahahahaha! You are truly a great soldier! Your vision is keen like lightning, just like the Great Tengu!" At that age, the conceited shogun tended to laugh in a loud and obnoxious manner, which was most unseemly. After that, Yoichi made numerous contributions for the shogun, executing many monsters and unfortunate mortals. It goes without saying that she probably made some of the stories up. But what she truly became renowned for was the final battle of that world, a world in which she spent a hundred years. In that naval battle, the shogun and rebels braved storms to wage bloody warfare between the straits. The monsters numbered at least eight million, maybe eight million more than that, while the mortal samurai must have numbered in the tens of millions. In terms of casualties, the headcount cannot be known, but what is known is that 800 thousand ships sank in the course of the battle. Yoichi reached this staggering tally with my assistance as she was vomiting up a bellyful of wine by the window. As is typical of so many stories about bitterly fought wars stuck in stalemate, brave heroes from both sides mowed down their enemies like blades of grass, painting the sea blood-red, while the rival generals stubbornly refused to back down, preferring to stay locked in intransigence than to withdraw their troops and head home to get a good night's sleep. Finally, on one cold moonlit night, a small boat slowly floated out from enemy lines. A lone figure stood on the boat, swaying like a reflection in the water. Beside the figure was a shimmering flagpole with a paper fan at the top. It gave off a golden glow in the moonlight. "Argh, ARGH... I am furious, furious! This blatant provocation cannot be tolerated!" The shogun squinted his eyes, saw the golden fan in the distance, and instantly flew into a rage. Yoichi couldn't understand why the shogun's self-esteem was so fragile, but was too lazy to empathize with the petty mortal sense of dignity. At that moment, she... no, "he," fixed his keen tengu gaze on the floating figure in the boat. What he saw was a woman, and an altogether different one than Yoichi. Moments later, a single arrow flew across the moon and tore apart the night sky. &#91; Note 3 &#93; "Haha, great!" Soon, the shogun's shouting was drowned out by the cheers of the army. "If those two old-timers find out what they have lost, they'd probably be so angry they'd rupture their spleens!" Yoichi let out a conceited and mischievous laugh. She was drunk. The Great Tengu had a certain twinkle in her eye, of the rather repulsive variety, that she made no attempt to cover up. What had happened was that as the arrow flew through the air, Yoichi had already spread out her giant wings and flown across the strait, snatching the golden paper fan and the bewildered beauty holding onto it as she passed over the boat. She then took the opportunity to push over the insufferably loud-mouthed shogun, and flew away from the battle. A perfect tengu snatch and grab. It was just a shame that... "Well, you know what happened, she was a neko. &#91; Note 4 &#93; She scratched me to pieces..." Yoichi stuck out her tongue and sighed with exasperation. "Oh right, it's snapper season! You should take some back with you." "Hmm? The stingy Great Tengu has a heart?" "I meant for that woman!" Seeing the threatening gaze from the greatly tipsy Great Tengu, I hastily gathered the remaining snapper in my arms and left. Vol. 3 Mother once warned that a beautiful face can hide deceptive intentions. If she looks as lovely as the moonlight, she must either be a fox spirit, or some old bake-neko &#91; Note 5 &#93; hag of significant power — Tanuki Historical Commentary Osen's Tale I left Yoichi's house and followed the winding alley for a while, then turned into a narrow street to arrive at that old lady's home. When the night is pitch black and the moon has climbed its peak, the neko awaken from their slumber. It is said that neko who have lived up for hundreds or even thousands of years can easily take on the form of a young woman, tempting people into doing funny and foolish things or chasing innocent travelers out of some sense of spiteful vengeance. But that's just the stuff of mortal imagination. In fact, the bake-neko only take on the form of young women when they're especially angry. Most of the time, the prefer to take on the form of an older woman, partly because it matches their crafty and cantankerous nature, but also because they can use old age as a disguise, portraying themselves as gentle souls to poor unsuspecting passers-by. "Hey, that's not free!" At the sound of the voice, I raised my head to see a young woman sitting on the eaves, as if she'd been there for a while. Her face was obscured by the shadows, and all I could make out was something resembling a smile on her face and golden-green light reflected by her eyes. Moonlight flowed from her semi-exposed shoulders down her dress, trickling through the gaps in the hem of her skirt and outlining her long slender legs with porcelain-white luster. She has absent-mindedly playing with a kendama in her hand. Yep, the old lady was definitely furious... "Tut-tut, you're late again tonight." "Of course, s—sorry." Mosquitoes kept bumping into the paper lamp, causing it to flicker lethargically in response. As the moon shone down, a humid wind arose. Before long, it had brought the cicadas' cries to a stop. With her hair flowing down, the lady turned the spinning wheel with a perverse smile on her face. It was quite terrifying. Now, despite my being a tanuki on friendly-enough terms with the tengu to sit and drink with them, even I have to be on my very best behavior around the bake-neko. So, I promptly prostrated myself and apologized profusely for my transgression. "Never mind, never mind. Since the snapper is still fresh, you can get up." With great difficulty on account of my rotund tanuki form, I resumed a normal seated position. The young woman slowly transformed back into an old woman, who had a kindly but strange smile on her face. "Thank you, Auntie Sen." Call me Osen! &#91; Note 6 &#93; I was relived. But something still felt off. "Hahahaha, anyway, how's that fool doing these days?" With a slurp, Osen swallowed one of the fish whole, including the tail. As for the story of how her fate became intertwined with that of the Great Tengu, the facts can only be described as farcical. We have already heard the ridiculous tales from Yoichi's perspective, but the bake-neko tells a completely different story. Osen wasn't born in our world, but one where mortals were much more savage. One night, in a bamboo forest, the young Osen was captured by a wandering monk. After passing through many hands, she was eventually sold to the shogun and became some sort of "Obake-neko." She has few memories of those days beyond wondering why the high-ranking officials of the mortal world enjoyed annoying her and playing with her. Every day, she was driven to scratch her enemies to pieces, or forced to play boring games which only they seemed to enjoy. This went on for such a long time that any normal person would have been driven to madness. But youkai live such long lives that they have far more patience than mortals. Later, when her shogun and the rebels' shogun started fighting, Osen transformed into a ninja. "This is where the story gets even more boring..." Osen squinted her eyes as she said this, letting out a huge yawn that stretched from ear to ear. On the night of that naval battle, the shogun thought of an ingenious scheme... The shogun ordered Osen to transform into a beautiful young woman and stand on a small boat with a golden fan to humiliate the rebels so that they dare not approach. Even if they did, the bake-neko would teach them a brutal lesson. But of course, Yoichi was standing amidst the ranks of the rebels... "But of course, that fool suddenly stood up and starting ranting and raving about shooting down the fan with a single arrow." Then the Great Tengu... "... Slipped and fell, landing in the ocean with a great splash." The old woman's feline face failed to stifle a smile, and erupted into jeering laughter. "She was so drunk that night that she though the seas were the stormiest she'd ever seen. In fact, the moon shone calmly and coolly, and there was not a trace of wind." "But it'd been a few hundred years since I'd seen someone so entertaining. So, to save her the humiliation, I stifled my laughter and took the paper fan down myself... Then, a roar of cheers came from their fleet. Just thinking about it amuses me to this day." Next, the Great Tengu unfurled her giant wings and leaped into the air, like a cloud covering the moon, and swooped down towards the beautiful woman... "A flurry of arrows later, and she fell into the sea looking like a hedgehog. I couldn't keep a straight face any longer and started laughing uncontrollably." Laughing raucously, Osen dragged the ill-fated tengu from the sea, put her in a headlock, and flew over the fleets from both sides, laughing maniacally and causing both generals to lose their tempers. People says she flew over eight ships in a row, &#91; Note 7 &#93; then disappeared into the night. The feline youkai's laughter could be heard for more than three days after the battle has finished. "I couldn't stop laughing, so I scratched her as hard as I could... But the sorry state she was in made me laugh even harder, and the harder I scratched, the harder I laughed, hahahahaha..." The neko transformed into an old lady and laughed uncontrollably. "Afterwards, she brought me to this world and treated me like I was some kind of trophy!" The old woman pursed her lips as her face transformed into that of a sulky young woman. But this looked quite comical, because her cheeks were still flushed bright red from having laughed so hard she could barely breathe. "I am NOT a trophy!" "Hmm, now that I think about it, that's probably the whole reason why she doesn't dare to visit me herself." The elderly female with feline features and the face of a young woman sighed gently, then smiled a cunning smile once more. "You should go. Leave the door open, and come back on the the next full moon." "Also, don't forget to take this raincoat over to our old friend." Vol. 4 "Planning ahead" may be akin to getting a raincoat from an old bake-neko before walking headlong into the driving rain. It is said that when a bell rings while it's pouring, this must be an old acquaintance coming uninvited — Tanuki Historical Commentary The Tale of Granny Ame After leaving Osen's house, I turned left, then right along a winding alley to a damp courtyard, and arrived at Granny Ame's home. In the elegant courtyard, even the cicadas' chirps were silenced. There was only the quiet trickle of water droplets in the suikinkutsu, accompanied by the rhythmic thumps of the shishi-odoshi. Long ago, in the mountains and forests where youkai could lead carefree lives, the lady who could turn mist into rain was a good friend of the tanuki and kitsune. Naturally, us youkai are vastly different from mortals. We don't have complicated troubles that plague us, nor do we have things like status or class. But in the mountains shrouded in mist and rain, the soft-spoken Ameonna always managed to gain more respect and adoration. It was later, when everyone had submitted to the Great Gongen. Good times came for mortals, and youkai either lived in seclusion at various places, or were subjected to destruction and suppression... It was then that Granny Ame moved to Toki Alley. As a token of sympathy, the Kitsune of Grand Narukami Shrine , Lady Guuji , gave her this mansion. What kind of loss and sorrow led to Lady Guuji takins special care of Granny Ame? I'm really curious. Stopping briefly in the courtyard, I watched the crescent moon swaying in the pond, as her voice rang gently in the cool night breeze. "My apologies to have kept you waiting for so long." When I turned around, I saw Ameonna standing by the door. She was bathed in pale moonlight, her long white dress shone with a dewy sheen, but her young and slender figure exuded a melancholic aura of a bygone era. So, I looked down and hastily handed over the raincoat that Osen passed to me, not daring to look directly into her pale gray eyes. It is rumored among mortals that the eyes of the sorrowful Ameonna will take on the marble gray-white hue of a drowning person. Those who dare to look directly into these woeful eyes will be lost forever in the incomprehensible fog of rain. Of course, that's just a silly legend among mortals, but the basic etiquette like "Don't look into the eyes of the sorrowful Ameonna" is indeed an unwritten rule among youkai. "Thank you." Granny Ame's voice was as soft and gentle as ever, like morning dew in the mist. She didn't invite me in, nor did she share her story. All I was handed was a wooden box, but that's all I needed to know. So, while the moon was bright, I quietly left the courtyard. Vol. 5 When sheltering from the rain under the same roof as a foxy-eyed friend, one would do well to keep watch for pranks. This, for sooth, has been tanuki teaching for years untold — Tanuki Historical Commentary The Tale of Gonbei Gonbei is 76 years old and is the only mortal living in Toki Alley. He was a farmer, a samurai, and a craftsman. The box in my hand is his handiwork, its smooth black lacquer surface inlaid with an iridescent mother-of-pearl. This was a craft he learned from the fishermen of Watatsumi Island . "Thank you for your hard work." The old man in front of me bowed his head deeply. Although I privately thought that this was the way mortals were supposed to behave towards youkai, I still felt a twinge of pity for his melancholy. According to Gonbei, contrary to popular legend, he was once close friends with the Ameonna who roamed the mountains and forests. It's just that, Gonbei, who was a teenager at the time, was trying to bring rain to the drought-stricken fields of his hometown. He thus heeded the village elder's words and went to the mountains to seek help from the Ameonna. At that time, Granny Ame was no longer young and was keenly aware of the many changes in the world. But the beings of the mountains and forests are always more simple and naxc3xafve, compared to mortals. Hmm, what happened later? The young Gonbei made the unspeakable mistake of deceiving the beings of the mountains and seas. Although to this day, he still insists that his deceit was to save his hometown. And his village did have a rare harvest year because of the heavy rainfall. After that, Gonbei, who was deeply ashamed, avoided the mountains far away and came to live in the city for a long time. "I'm so sorry." The elderly mortal bowed his head, but did not take the wooden box. I left his house, before the moonlight was shrouded by dark clouds. Vol. 6 There will always be time to feast. The sly fox deeply understands the meaning of loss, but those who rule over others are no better than children in this regard — Tanuki Historical Commentary Break Time They say that in the past, before the fragile and short-lived mortals had crossed over the sea to these lands, Inazuma was once a land that belonged to the tanuki. Lazy and fickle by nature, the tanuki never worried about tomorrow, nor did they carry today's troubles with them through the night. During that period, the land of Inazuma was a cozy paradise for the tanuki and every day was a fun-filled festival. At least, that's what the tanuki elders say. Later on, the kitsune arrived by sea, forcing the tanuki into a great war that lasted first for 800 years and then for another 800 years, with both sides suffering heavy casualties, until eventually the only option was to hold peace talks. The tanuki are a stubborn bunch and to this day still don't admit defeat, but the fact remains that they ceded the giant Thunder Sakura to the kitsune. But the kitsune are a crafty and cunning bunch too, and equally skilled in the art of shape-shifting. It is said that in that great war, as a consequence of the constant switcheroo trickery, many poor souls became completely disoriented and could not for the life of them keep track of who was who — eventually forgetting even who they were, what they were, and which side they were supposed to be on. Thus were the hapless mortals born. The product of bewildered youkai. I wandered through the winding streets and alleys, while recapping the long-held stories of the tanuki clan. In the end, I didn't find a restaurant that was still open. I guess this means it's time to go back. With this in mind, I stood up and stretched my back in front of Uncle Kitsune's soba stand. Just then, a familiar scent came from behind— Notes xe2x86x91 In Shinto - Buddhist beliefs, a gongen ( Japanese : xe6xa8xa9xe7x8fxbe ) is believed to be a manifestation of Buddha as an indigenous kami, appearing to guide people towards salvation. xe2x86x91 Jikininki ( Japanese : xe4xbaxbaxe9xa3x9fxe3x81x84xe9xacxbc Hitogui-oni ) are flesh-eating demons or oni . Their English name comes from xe9xa3x9fxe4xbaxbaxe9xacxbc Jikininki . xe2x86x91 Reference to the feat of Nasu no Yoichi at Battle of Yashima . xe2x86x91 Neko ( Japanese : xe7x8cxab ) means "cat." In the Japanese version of this line, Yoichi says xe7x8cxabxe3x83x90xe3x83x90xe3x82xa1 neko-baba , which roughly translates to "Granny Cat," wherein xe3x83x90xe3x83x90xe3x82xa1 baba is an informal (and typically derogatory) way of referring to an old woman. xe2x86x91 " Bake-neko " ( Japanese : xe5x8cx96xe3x81x91xe7x8cxab bake-neko , lit. "changed cat" ) is a cat youkai. xe2x86x91 In the Japanese version, the narrating tanuki calls Osen xe5x8dx83xe5xa9x86xe6xa7x98 Sen-baba-sama , wherein xe5xa9x86 baba again means "old woman." Because it is written with proper kanji, it does not carry a negative connotation like Yoichi's version ( xe3x83x90xe3x83x90xe3x82xa1 ) did, and the tanuki additionally adds the honorific suffix xe6xa7x98 -sama to further denote its respect. Nonetheless, Sen insists that the tanuki call her Osen ( Japanese : xe3x81x8axe5x8dx83 ), using the polite honorific prefix xe3x81x8a O instead. xe2x86x91 Reference to the feat of Minamoto no Yoshitsune at Battle of Dan-no-Ura .The princess who was prophesied to bring destruction witnesses the imminent fall of her nation, and it is at this moment when a wandering warrior descends from the skies, ignorant of the truth. The pair's journey amidst the fires of an ancient warring period are about to begin! Thirteen years of peace were had before the era of warring states began. The nations of the north, furthest from the epicenter, at last became infected by the spirit of the age, hurling themselves into the flames of war. As it is with most wars, a loser would be decided after a fierce conflict. Their cities were cast down into flaming rubble, and their nobles and their supporters fled into the mountains. Such a backdrop is hardly anything special. But into that inflection point of an era strode a wandering samurai dressed in luxurious robes. No, rather than "luxurious," perhaps it was more accurate to say that these robes were... Yes, that's right. It was a man dressed as a woman. In contrast, this samurai was accompanied by a petite girl wearing a haori that was large to the point of incredulity. In any case, they were a suspicious pair for sure. However, the two of them sauntered up to the checkpoint at the foot of the mountains as if unaware of this fact. Of course, they were immediately stopped by the ashigaru guarding the checkpoint. "Who are you?" This was a standard thing to say, but it was also an honest question in this case. "As you can see, we're just ordinary passers-by." It was a reply with no powers of persuasion. But the ashigaru who asked almost seemed to hesitate at the sheer lack of doubt in the samurai's tone. "Well, uh, could I ask you to come with me anyway?" "Ah. That didn't work, huh.." The samurai almost seemed disappointed. Suddenly, three ashigaru fell to the ground. "You planned to do this all along, didn't you? You horrible knave." The girl grumbled softly from the rear. Vol. 2 "A princess who brings destruction. Hah. Isn't that just an excuse for making war?" They travel to the center of the world in search of the truth behind the prophecy. The super-popular romantic adventure continues! "That's not it." These words burst out suddenly. In the nameless mountain shrine, the black-haired princess sat still, her face flickering between light and shadow in the face of a flame. "What do you mean 'that's not it'?" Came the reply, almost as a conditioned reflex. "What I mean, you dumb samurai, is: don't you have any thoughts concerning me, the princess who brings destruction?" "Thoughts? Well, I think you're quite the character, for one." "I don't mean 'thoughts' in that sense." Princess Mina sounded quite exasperated now. "I mean with regards to saving me." "Strictly speaking, I didn't save you." The samurai corrected. "At that time, you ordered me to take you away in your capacity as princess. In that sense, you saved yourself." "Oh, is that how you see it?" An expected reply. Well, the samurai thought, it had been worth a shot trying to dodge responsibility. "In any case, this 'princess who brings destruction' nonsense... Hah. Isn't that just an excuse for making war?" The samurai's lackadaisical tone shifted. "Also," The samurai turned around, void-like eyes now aflame. "'Destroying the world' is an utterly stupid concept. You'll understand soon enough." Vol. 3 The two, who have entered the field of battle, finally witness the true Avici. The truth behind the fires of war that have swept across the world will be revealed here! This volume comes with some super value-added extras! People call war hell, but most are just describing it as such. But what appeared before their eyes could only truly be called "hell." The desolate earth, the withered trees, and people like the shambling dead. It was like the life had been wrung from this place. "Huh." The samurai picked a husk of a leaf. It crumbled into dust immediately, floating away on the wind. "It seems like the life has literally been wrung out from this place." Conflict had raged around the capital for over a century now. After the first decade, the resources and riches of the various warring nations had already been all but spent. The thing that had sustained the bloodshed for so long was something known as Nakura's Hex. Nakura's Hex was a terrifying sorcery that sucked the life of all living things and the land itself dry, giving it unto powerful samurai and feeding the war effort. And those who used such depraved magics to dominate the land were scoundrels known as the Nakura Daimyo. The Daimyo vied for dominance, but no matter who won, the earth would be further robbed of life. This was the true face of the war that had raged for nearly a century now. "And the ones who created the Hex are the Onmyouji who dwell in the Sky Tower at the center of the world." Ignoring Princess Mina, who had wavered at the sight before her eyes, the samurai continued faintly, "O 'princess who brings destruction'... Has this world not already been destroyed?" Vol. 4 "Go back to hell, you jumped-up vengeful spirit!" The riveting flashback chapter! What lies within the warrior's buried past? Here comes a new chapter in the adventures of the princess who lost her nation and the warrior! The nation of Kogami — a lifeless wasteland as far as the eye could see. The barren fields stretched out into the horizon around a large sand dune where the two samurai faced each other. One of them is our protagonist, and shall be named the green samurai to distinguish him from his compatriot. The other is a new arrival to the story. We shall name him the pale samurai. If this were a swashbuckler's tale, then they would have already taken up battle stances. But the two were not here to have a decisive match. They were just facing each other. "Came back from hell, did you?" The pale samurai said, the weight of time unknowable lying between them. "Nostalgic, isn't it?" The green samurai seemed quite happy. "I don't get nostalgic over such things." The pale samurai interrupted rudely. The green samurai closed their eyes, as if sinking into the abyss of the past. "'This will all end as long as we defeat the evil overlords.' That's what we believed then. Naive fools that we were — that was just the beginning of the nightmare." "The thirteen samurai banded together to defeat the Nakura Daimyo who had been destroying this nation." "But Kogami did not revive with the Daimyo gone, and the life-force of the land continued to bleed away." "Not only that — Kogami, now bereft of its ruler, became a paradise for those who would plunder it." "The heroes who had defeated the wicked overlord could not protect it in the end either." "In the end, only two escaped." "...Hey now, cut the reminiscence out for a second. We've got things to settle, don't we?" Vol. 5 "If this world requires your sacrifice to be saved, then it might as well burn." Having reached the Sky Tower at the heart of the world at last, is this... finally the end of the pair's tale? "I want to save this world!" Princess Mina said. "I've told you this many times before. There's no such thing as 'saving this world.' Now, this hasn't stopped idiots like me from trying, of course. But this world... it's doomed." "I don't care. I'm a princess. Aren't princesses born to save the world?" "No, I've never heard of any story that goes like that. And last I heard, you were the princess who brings destruction." "Last I heard, someone said that this 'destruction' is actually the birth of new life." "Well, I don't know where you heard that one, but such beliefs are old hat by now. If you wrote this drivel nowadays, people would chuck it into the nation of Tokoyo, and that would be for the best." (The Princess covers her ears) At the top of the Sky Tower, the samurai and princess argued in futility, as if no one was watching. Well, I say that, but in fact there were quite a few other folk about dressed in the garb of onmyouji. "So, uh, as you all know, Nakura's Hex was originally created to preserve the vitality of a world that was slowly declining." As if unable to stand the conversation — and also to push the plot forward in their role as an NPC — the oldest onmyouji finally spoke. "And that which can utilize this stored vitality..." "So, could you get these thoughts out of your head?" The samurai didn't seem to have heard the wizened onmyouji at all. How long was this farce going to continue? Vol. 6 The truth of the world is revealed — and what a terrible joke it is! Even when separated, the two cannot escape the chains of fate. This may be the final volume of "Princess Mina of the Fallen Nation," but our story isn't over yet! "So, was the world saved?" At the story's end, the samurai walked amidst the boundless desert. The Sky Tower's plans were probably complete by now, and vitality remaining in the world had all been stored up. There was no knowing if a new world had been created, but this one was most certainly done for. Ah, what could one expect of a princess destined to destroy the world? "Might as well destroy another world... if it exists." And so the samurai embarked on a new journey. ...

preliminary volume of the "Flowers for Princess Fischl" series. This work originally came in a violet and black wooden box as a limited edition gift, but many hardcore fans of the series who wanted to collect the whole saga were enraged by the great amount of content versus the small number of copies printed. Due to this, Yae Publishing House would name this book "Volume 0" and sell it separately. Eventually, the original work, the boxed collector's edition, and Volume O would all come to be regarded as standard by fans. Phantasmagoria "... The dream lives on." Such words surely must appear the midst of every tale, and they are largely the words of the &#8203; Kaiserin German for "empress" &#8203; of the &#8203; Immernachtreich German for "evernight-empire" &#8203;. This, surely, is not the enigma that concerns the greatest majority of readers, but we must still start here nonetheless. Ozvaldo Hrafnavins The mighty lord of the &#8203; Nachtraben German for "night-raven" &#8203;. If Fischl's strength in battle might be considered a ten, and the Beasts of the World should have an average of fifteen, then Ozvaldo's strength may be considered thirteen. His great power was on display when he destroyed &#8203; Dxc3xa4mmerung German for "twilight" &#8203; in Volume 1. *That said, the &#8203; Nachtvorhang German for "night-curtain" &#8203; is itself the nemesis of &#8203; Dxc3xa4mmerung German for "twilight" &#8203; anyway. As for the feelings that Ozvaldo holds towards Fischl, Mr. Nine does not believe it to be romance, but more likely a form of imprinting common to bird-kindred. ( Editor-in-Chief 's Note: Regardless of what the author says, dear readers, you are free to interpret the personal relationships of the characters from Immernachtreich however you like.) Aside from this, the title "Prince &#8203; Nachtraben German for "night-raven" &#8203;" is not a particularly high-flown one, considering that the night ravens have always been known for being conspirators and bearers of curses. Ozvaldo likely insisted on this title, for how could a mere "King of the Night" call himself thus before the Immernachtreich? Beast of the World: Gesamtkunstwerk &#91; Note 1 &#93; In certain probabilities, this is the Beast of the World that the Immernachtreich would be faced with in this cycle. Its battle strength is around thirty. In a distant causality, if the philosopher Zarathustra &#91; Note 2 &#93; was not chosen, then the opera writer would have gained victory in the contest over the will of the world. Once Gesamtkunstwerk takes the stage in the opera theater of the apocalypse, many more Beasts of the World that reside within the center of the universe will inexorably begin to appear as well. In the final volume, the weakness of the Beast of the World: Saint of Seven Tears (whose combat strength was ten, and therefore equal to Fischl) was quite out of the ordinary, and the Saint merely wept for Zarathustra at first, a choice that seems undeserving of any blame. Both Zarathustra and The Musician exist to give praise unto the Prinzessin der Vererteilung&#32;&#91; sic &#93;. One proclaims the agony she suffers in her heart, while the other proclaims the grandeur of her travails. The Prinzessin, of course, will not favor the latter, for of such things would she be ashamed. Sommernachtgarten &#91; Note 3 &#93; It is said that those who are highly skilled in the magical arts will possess their own unique domains of consciousness. Their loves, hatreds, yearnings, jealousies, adherence, and passions of the soul will be stored here. In the fictional tales of other novels, this space is called Summerland. &#91; Note 4 &#93; The Sommernachtgarten of the Prinzessin is something in this vein. That this concept was never well-explored in the end remains quite the pity. The Suspected Eternal Return Quite a few of the finer points of the tale have caused people to wonder if the &#8203; Kaiserin German for "empress" &#8203; of the Immernachtreich once experienced all that Fischl has. Fischl's father is undoubtedly not a mere shade. He is majestic and mighty, and helps Fischl to dispel her confusions. As for Fischl's mother, the &#8203; Kaiserin German for "empress" &#8203;, her actions and deeds show her to have quite an interesting character indeed. But she will only speak one line, which is, as was noted earlier in this text, "the dream lives on." In the final volume, Fischl's mother had already faded away, and so this volume, naturally, did not have this preceding line. But as the universe entered its denouement and all things within it flowed into the Immernachtreich, she spoke another line of enigmatic intent— "Find meaning somewhere. The night deepens." "Find meaning somewhere. The night deepens, but the dream lives on." Dear readers, I hope that you will all find happiness in this world where the sun still rises each day. Collection of Questions and Answers Q: Dear Mr. Nine, may I ask what the relationship between the Celestial Emperor's daughter in " Legend of the Shattered Halberd " and Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort is? A: I felt that the tragedy that unfolded toward the end of Volume 5 of "Legend of the Shattered Halberd" was due to the male protagonist, and the Celestial Emperor's daughter's attraction to him. As such, I wanted to write a Prinzessin der Vererteilung&#32;&#91; sic &#93; who had no need of a male protagonist. This was the scaffold that would come to be "Flowers for Princess Fischl." Eventually, though, I did write the sixth volume of "Halberd," which rescued the ending. There was probably some cross-pollination in the process of writing two series at the same time, but I was personally quite pleased with the result. Q: In a fight between Mir's dad (Khan the Asura and his sword Laevatain) at full strength versus Gesamtkunstwerk, who would come out on top? A: I originally intended to refuse to answer this question, but the editor-in-chief said that she'd axe my next manuscript if I didn't. In which case, my Mora would be on Gesamtkunstwerk. Q: Mr. Nine, you mentioned in "Farewell Frau Welt" &#91; Note 5 &#93; that you were suffering from hair loss. Are you doing better now? A: Could the Yae Publishing House not accept this sort of question? And do people actually read what gets added in these new editions? (Editor-in-Chief's Note: Oh, but the readers are very concerned about you! And yes, they are also very concerned with the purchase of new editions.)A Jinni tells a tale on the night wind, a story about itself and a shepherd. It's a story of unknown origin and is full of absurdities. "The next story I'll tell comes from the age of Shiruyeh , the Lord of Pestilence, though at this time, that vassal ruler had not yet gained notoriety for Shiruyeh's Plague, nor had his subjects been scattered amidst a world of darkness, left to become wild creatures who had lost their language and faces..." The fairy of the moon maiden's city paused for a moment, then stretched out lazily. The moonlit silver coins jangled on her wrists and ankles as if displeased with the jouncing of the Sumpter Beast . "Anyway, little raven, do you know the meaning of the name "Shiruyeh"?" "Uh... 'One who is ridiculous and despicable'?" The youth whom she had rather one-sidedly named "Raven" answered casually. Suffering the heat of the sun and the threat of quicksand, he had little interest in his travel companion's stories. "In our tribe, 'Shiruyeh' is a disgraceful name branded only onto the foreheads of exiled chiefs and spoken only in curses and mockery. It's a tradition of ours... But I'm sure that the traditions of other tribes are not so different." "Haha! Mortal awareness is just like quicksand, shifting with the winds of time. How bizarre!" "Raven" replied perfunctorily, drawing an unexpectedly enthusiastic taunt from the fairy, "Now, actually... in the lost language, 'Shiruyeh' means 'unweaned lion cub'. His father Parvezravan gave this name to his newborn son, oblivious that he, the vassal king who referred to himself as the 'Spirit of Unceasing Victory,' would be torn apart by his own beloved 'lion cub'..." The fairy paused, seemingly afraid that her audience was getting bored, and exchanged glances with the youth before continuing her tale: "As for this Parvezravan, legend has it that in the days when mortals ruled as vassal kings, he was one of the mightiest among them..." "Parvezravan was not, in fact, the original name of this vassal king. As the spirits tell it, he was an orphan who was raised in the nest of the giant bird Ghoghnus and given the name 'Kisra,' or 'one who has been bestowed a good name.' Later, his aspiration to greatness and the aid of this divine bird saw him adopted by the vassal king Ormazd Shah , and he would eventually rise to become a sage and hero among mortals. In the songs of the now-vanished desert people, Kisra plundered the four corners of the land in the name of his king, Ormazd Shah. By his hand, the bronze and mortar towers of ninety-nine cities were destroyed or abandoned. By his hand, the leaders of ninety-nine nomadic tribes were defeated. And by his hand, ninety-nine sages with knowledge of the order of the stars were bound in golden chains, then led back to the towering royal city of Gurabad to be imprisoned. At that time, the promised land of "Valivija" was engulfed by wild, gilded sands, and one of the three living gods had fallen. Amidst a century of chaos and confusion, the scattered mortals ensconced themselves in vassal states until my lord Al-Ahmar and the Sage-King of the Greenwood gathered their subjects. Once the oasis paradise was reconstructed, the age of the vassal kings, the age of division, finally came to a close. Returning to our preceding tale, Ormazd's crown grew all the more valuable on the back of Kisra's exploits, until finally his own neck could no longer bear its weight, forcing him to leave it ever suspended from chains of pure gold in the center of the main hall. The vassal king Ormazd Shah rewarded young Kisra's unrivaled achievements amply: He bestowed the name "Parvez" upon his adopted son and offered his daughter Shirin 's hand to him in marriage. In the ethereal songs of the spirits, as the heir of both the mortal vassal king and the foremother Liloufar , she possessed superior wisdom and was blessed with an infinite lifespan and, like the original sages, could foresee the fortunes and misfortunes of the present moment. If Kisra Parvez had stopped there, his reputation as a hero would have continued unblemished. But one cursed day, Ormazd and all 300 of his offspring suddenly died in one night in the city of Gurabad. Following such an unthinkable event, the throne naturally fell to Kisra, who added "Ravan" to his title and became the most powerful vassal king among mortals. "..." The fairy abruptly stopped her tale and looked up at the red sun that was now sinking behind the sand dunes. She then whistled sharply, signaling to the youth to halt the Sumpter Beast and prepare to make camp for the night under the crumbling stone pillars. "Some people say..." The fairy lithely leaped down from the Sumpter Beast and circled across the sands in a manner not unlike the long-lost dancers of Setaria, letting the moon's first light evenly coat her translucent skin in its silvery sheen. The scent of myrrh swirled around her myriad braids as the golden bells rang out into the distance.Then, the fairy leaned over slightly, balancing on the tips of her toes as she laughed softly. Some people say that the tragedy that befell the city of Gurabad was the handiwork of the hero Kisra. Some people say that the night the tragedy took place, an evil, clawless bird flew out from the redoubt and wailed throughout the night without stopping to eat or drink. The castle was then struck by a plague of rats with human faces, which gnawed at the gold chains from which the crown hung, causing the cumbersome thing to crash heavily to the ground, broken and bent. People say that the crown made such an earth-shaking noise when it fell that even the Fellahin servants, who had settled and toiled far from the redoubt, trembled with fear at this tyrant they had never met. Later still, it is said that an adventurer found the ancient crypts of the city of Gurabad beneath the gilded sands, in which were hidden the withered, massive remains of Ormazd and his offspring, An ancient, inscrutable inscription was left on each of the shriveled bodies... "I hope this story frightened you." The fairy watched keenly as the mortal boy before her drank from the waterskin. The tribes of the desert regard water with an instinctive restraint and prudence. Spirits, however, are born of pure elemental energy and know neither thirst nor the satisfaction of the pleasure of luxury, just like the ancient princess Shirin in this lament. "As for the daughter of the foremother Liloufar I mentioned, Shirin — why, our story has only just begun..." The fairy smiled slyly again, her eyes like an amalgam of amber and gold, her smiling face like the princess of her ancient homeland. Vol. 2 A Jinni tells a tale on the night wind, a story about itself and a shepherd. It's a story of unknown origin and is full of absurdities. At that time, the promised land of "Valivija" was engulfed by wild, gilded sands, and one of the three living gods had fallen. Amidst a century of chaos and confusion, the scattered mortals ensconced themselves in vassal states until my lord Al-Ahmar and the Sage-King of the Greenwood gathered their subjects. Once the oasis paradise was reconstructed, the age of the vassal kings, the age of division, finally came to a close. "Yes, you've mentioned this part of the story already." The youth's tone was rather impatient as he gazed at the full moon hanging in the starry sky, using the positions of its companion stars to determine the next day's route. But the spirit knew that he was, in truth, listening earnestly to her story. She couldn't refrain from letting out a triumphant snort, but was immediately annoyed by this unbecoming action: "The mortal mind is as fickle as it is forgetful. How should I know whether you were listening or not?" Back to the subject at hand — Shirin, according to the spirits' lamentations, was the daughter of the mortal hero Ormazd and the fairy Liloufar, the Daughter of the Water Lily. Born upon a lily pad amid fragrant dewdrops, the white ibis blessed her, and the cobra bequeathed to her a cerulean pearl, and even the mighty giant crocodile bowed to her in worship. As the foremother of the spirits, before she delivered her daughter to the mortal vassal king, Liloufar prophesied three times: First, that Shirin would fall in love with a great hero, and the progeny of their union would surpass their father. Second, that many of Shirin's relatives would enjoy a sweet end, and third, that Shirin alone would be given possession of her father's kingdom. Then, Liloufar gave three admonitions to her mortal darling: First, that her joy would bring tears to her father's eyes. Second, that they should no longer feast at the same table as their daughter after she was wed, and third, that their daughter's heir would be an ill omen upon the king's land. The king, however, only smiled at these prophecies and admonitions. "Later, Shirin's father offered her hand in marriage to the great hero 'Parvezravan,' fulfilling the first prophecy, right?" The youth said, interrupting the spirit's story. "That's correct, though, not entirely so..." The spirit laid a finger on the tip of the youth's nose and the latter hurriedly moved away, his face flushed as if he feared she might put some ethereal, deathly curse on him. The spirit once again found herself amused by such an innocent act. By the time Shirin grew a little older and more cognizant, the vision her mother laid out for her became a lingering curse. She spent her days awaiting her chance to fall in love with a hero, waiting for the day when she would inherit her father's kingdom, and longing for that sweet and perfect future — but it never came. Truth be told, Shirin's marriage to the hero Kisra was not a happy one — after all, mortal heroes are all warped people harboring the ambition to rule. The daughter of Liloufar carried the pride of the spirits, and thus she found the golden trap of the mortal hero's supposed affections hard to endure, and she found no peace between the bed and the hearth. And so at last, a vivid hatred coalesced from this passionless, dull, rotten life — the same hatred that those imprisoned in the silver bottle carry. Later, on the night of the infamous grand banquet, a few lowly slaves — mages of the Mazandaran Oasis, or perhaps some illiterate Fellahin servants — dripped scorpion venom into musk honey and offered it to the vassal king Ormazd and his 300 heirs. They then watched as they sunk into the sweet, dreamless landscape of death, drowning in the fat and blood of the wretched as their blood and tears flowed freely... And on this night, all who remained with dreams left to enjoy were Shirin, who had been excluded from the party by her own father, and her reluctant co-conspirator and husband, Kisra. The lowly regicides were thereupon submerged in the honey pot as punishment by the new king, and they cursed him with their last breaths as they choked on the sticky honey. And from the new king's mouth gushed blackened, dirtied, and bloodied lies, which gradually stained his hero's reputation a deep black... And so, the second prophecy was fulfilled. Later, Shiruyeh, the son of Kisra Parvezravan, grew to adulthood beloved by his mother, but was banished by his father from the towering city of Gurabad. Made by his father to hide his face and flee on a fast steed, Shiruyeh was henceforth forbidden from setting foot in the city again. Undoubtedly terrified of the fairy-mother Liloufar's warning, it was Parvezravan's fixation that gave rise to the cowardice that spurred this decision. And so, Shirin once again found the perfect opportunity for revenge in the vassal king's unfettered fear. One night, she disguised herself as a divine princess of the temple to the moon goddess and met with her prodigal son who had sojourned there. In the lingering silvery light that danced amidst the dew-dotted lilies, she gave the masked wayfarer this false, illusory prophecy: "Is the tyranny of the wanderer's father not his greatest misfortune? O darling of the moon goddess, everywhere the moonlight touches is yours to rule, and every seed you sow shall grow and flourish. Since the moonlight has granted you a good bow and a sharp blade, why do you suffer that coward idling upon the throne? Why not muster up the courage to face your hatred, to face yourself?" Legend has it that just as Shiruyeh hesitated in indecision, a gust of wind rushed through the night and blew the veil Shirin had used to conceal her face away. Seeing that familiar face, the young man who had been forced to cover his was instantly overcome with terror and shame. He fled the sullied temple in a panic, and laughter soft as the ringing of a bell and the cruel moonlight bore witness to his fear. The story from here is a lackluster one: The peerless vassal king "Parvezravan" would be stabbed to death in his bed by his own masked, unfilial son, and his magnificent bed — once adorned with sapphire and golden animal horns — would be indelibly stained with his blood. The dirge of the spirits then goes like this: After committing this crime of treason, Shiruyeh wept bitterly before his mother Shirin in repentance. But Shirin did not reprimand him. Rather she took her beloved son into her arms, removed the brass mask symbolizing his exile, and left him with an affectionate kiss of benediction. After Shiruyeh claimed the throne, he was long tormented by inescapable nightmares until finally, on a frenzied night of wandering, he fell into a deep black chasm in the earth and disappeared. Later, a great plague emerged from that chasm and swallowed up half of the souls in the city of Gurabad. The kingdom, having lost its vassal king and his servants, fell into ruin and was gradually devoured by that insatiable yellow sand. The scattered survivors of this calamity called it "Shiruyeh's Plague" — the divine retribution invited by the absurdly short-lived despot himself. As for his mother Shirin, Liloufar's third prophecy was indeed fulfilled — She and the heir she bore won true freedom in a kingdom ravaged by vengeance, and they became evil apparitions, death knells to the conceited. "Some people say that Shirin was later subdued by my lord Al-Ahmar, who detained her in a magic silver bottle. Others say that she still roams the desert, tormenting overconfident adventurers and tirelessly searching for the beloved child that she lost to that dark world..." The fairy smiled proudly, having theatrically concluded the story. At this time, the moon was already high in the sky, and the distant, ancient time when the desert had not yet become a desert was nigh. It was time for the divine princess to hold the sacrifice.A biography written by researchers from ancient Sumeru. It records the trail of the Dendro Archon during the times of calamity . ...I don't dare presume to mention her true name, let alone overstep my bounds as an earthly being to judge her divinity. I, Sunitha Cosamvi, a servant of shallow intellect, have merely recorded the stories heard from the sages who followed her in the past and nowhere else. These words are as true and evident as my own existence. When the moon's shadow shattered, hordes of beasts emerged from the deepest depths of the abyss and devoured living creatures by the thousands. Of those she created, none could escape their destined annihilation. The goodness, peace, and wisdom she had bestowed — all perished before this pure malice without exception. Under that sneering waning moon, the black tide of decay surged over the deserts and through the valleys, turning clear springs once interlaced with roses into puddles of filth, defiling the earth as mortals trembled with despair. The sages called it The Black Tide , for it was a dark flood that swallowed up fields, villages, and cities. She witnessed this all with her own eyes and wept bitterly for the sorrow and suffering of the living. Her tears fell to the ground, dispelling the foul flames and giving birth to blossoms abounding with sweet dew from the once barren and scorched earth. However, the root cause of the blight still lay beneath the earth , and the shadow of death continued to obscure the once luminous moonlight. Thus, she vowed to save the creatures of the earth, embarking on a final journey together with her followers. Vol. 2 A biography written by researchers from ancient Sumeru. It records the trail of the Dendro Archon during the times of calamity. She followed the dappled light and shade until she entered a long-since ruined forest. With each step she took, a thousand Nilotpala Lotuses bloomed in her wake. Every calamity — raging fires, death, and destruction — all receded before the wonder of her wisdom. Fragrant flowers bloomed and proliferated again in this dead domain and remain as abundant today as the gravel in the Ardravi River . Even hurricanes abated into gentle exhalations before her singing, causing the bells on her lapels to sway as they rang out elegantly. All the spirits, their envoys, humans, and the inhuman rejoiced and praised her name, for she is indeed the most sagacious and the most merciful. In the depths of the forest, she collected grass to use as an instrument, picked flowers for a crown, and played a flawless tune with a Karrenay. In an instant, thousands of demonic troops were reduced to dust and scattered to the four winds, never to be found again. She gently brushed away the tears of the forest creatures and soothed their anguish, just as she once blew the wind of life across the barren sea of sand, like the emissary of an eternal oasis from time immemorial. But this land remained broken, its heart devoured by evil spirits and monsters who made it their dwelling — a cavern of the damned where neither sun, moon, nor fire shine. The dust they took for treasure and the sludge served as their delicacies, like birds clad in feathers but unable to soar in the skies. She decided that she would go to the dark cave and enter that evil place that none might depart, continuing on this path of no restitution, this sojourn of utmost purity and mercy. She stepped alone to that emptied earthly heart and softly touched its timeless face, becoming the immortal Gaokerena and the earth itself. Every thread of spiritual knowledge and every sweet-smelling plant is her undying will. Another flourishing sea of flowers rolled around her, jade in color, rosy in fragrance and dewy as heavenly raiment. The songs of a hundred birds surrounded her, praising the life that she had at last reclaimed, like a mortal trading their old clothes for fresh ones, casting off their original shackles, and ascending to the eternal temple. Vol. 3 A biography written by researchers from ancient Sumeru. It records the trail of the Dendro Archon during the times of calamity. Many people had never before heard her voice, or if they had, they did not know it was her. Those who disseminate well because they hear words from far and wide are as rare as those who teach well because they understand the truth. Her will is all-pervading and as indestructible as intellect itself. None can destroy the indestructible, for there has never been an absence of existence in this world, nor the existence of absence. It must be known that the forest was once overrun by a black tide of beasts. The moonlight spilling over the still water was as shattered as the dream it reflected, and the endless labyrinth too collapsed in the burning flames. The lord of all animals let out a furious roar with its dying breath, then fell protecting all that she had entrusted to him. But the memories themselves did not shatter, collapse, nor fall. Like the wisdom she left behind, they were unborn, imperishable, eternal, and ancient. Following her guidance, the princess of the kingdom of dreams gently snapped off the white branches and rebuilt the verdant hunting grounds from the withered fallen leaves, while the children of the forest, having set forth their ambition, were able to sleep peacefully in the end once more. No matter how much they suffer, the hunter always finds their way home — This is the first and final promise she made to the children, and to the adults who were once children. Perhaps the moon dust scattered over the world will one day fade away like morning dew, but for those things that remain in memories — all those sweet dreams and thoughts — their purity will remain as unchanged as a pearl that even the grinding and whittling of a thousand winds and sands may not alter.

The dust they took for treasure and the sludge served as their delicacies, like birds clad in feathers but unable to soar in the skies. So she made a great wish, vowing that she would go into those cankered, rotted courts, setting forth on her sojourn to cleanse the withered land. All the spirits, their envoys, humans, and the inhuman all watched as she entered the hollowed heart of the mortal world and touched its timeless face. Thus did all the goodness, peace, and wisdom that she had granted unto the world become the immortal Gaokerena, indeed, become the very earth itself. This was the moment when the pure lotuses would bloom. A flourishing sea of flowers rolled all about her, and like jade it appeared, rosy in fragrance and dewy as heavenly raiment. The songs of a hundred birds surrounded her, praising the youth that she had reclaimed. The years lost by the children of humanity were nowhere to be found again, like the wind that flows through the forest, but she returned in spite of all things, showing her incandescent divinity to the world once more, just as she had in the beginning when she sowed the first seeds into the desert sands. It is just as the hymn says: The path was made straight long ago by the path of a great vow; to break all chains and relieve all woes, and all things sure to know. The auspice of its radiant light drove foes and demons out; and amidst the rotting smoke did holy wisdom newly sprout. Behold wisdom's returning light, unclouded near or far; like sunlight through the morning sky, the moon through dome of stars. The lotuses do richly bloom in wisdom's radiant blaze; amidst this paradise of faith, I lift my hands in praise. Vol. 3 A biography written by researchers from ancient Sumeru. It records the trail of the Dendro Archon during the times of calamity. Many have never heard her voice, and even those who heard knew not that it was her — and still she heard their wishes. And many have never seen her face, and even those who saw her knew not that it was her — and still she watched over their dreams. For few are those who tell well the tales they hear from afar, and rare are those who teach the truth they have divined with clarity. Even today, her will permeates all, and she dwells in the Sanctuary of Surasthana watching over the dreams of all who live in this land — just as she did when she returned and commanded the queen of the realm of dreams to break the pure white branches and rebuild the viridescent hunting ground from amidst the withered leaves. The forest was once overrun by a tide of black beasts, and the endless labyrinth crumbled amidst the flames. The lord of all animals let out a furious roar with its dying breath, then fell protecting all that she had entrusted to him. But her lovely dream could never be snatched away by any woe — for so long as people wait for the next night's dream expectantly, then there shall be new memories, tranquil flowers that bloom betwixt morning dew and moon dust. This is the promise that she made to the dreamers, the first and final oath. For memories are like pearls — tossed about by wind and sand though they may be, their true, pure color shall never be changed. All beautiful dreams are like the newborn grass — though they may be consumed by sudden flame, the warm spring breeze shall bring them swaying to life again.

torn page discovered in the desert ruins and retrieved by researchers from the Vahumana school of the Akademiya . The author of this page has yet to be confirmed. ...When the Mistress of Pushpavatika heard this, she did not hesitate to humble herself. Resolute, she descended upon the grand palace of (...) with the intention of testing the princess 's wisdom. Countless maids, servants, and escorts surrounded the ever-gleaming princess, All dressed in fine linen and silk, like thousands of daytime stars wreathed around the only shining moon. (Herbad of Haravatat Tafazzoli 's Remarks: There is a mistranslation here — The word "silk" in the last sentence should be translated as "a textile that no one had ever seen before" so as not to lead the reader to confuse it with Liyue 's regional specialty . Additionally, the "grand palace" mentioned in the second sentence is not a true "palace" in the original text, nor does it refer to any actual "building." Rather, it refers to "a land where the divine is present." It would seem that the researchers of Vahumana who undertook the translation of this volume did not really understand the language of that era, but I shall earnestly annotate this document all the same.) ...The sweet fragrance lingered on the princess on that (hedge? garden? battlefield?), Like a stream winding around the shattered silver moonlight under the shade of a tree. From ancient times till now, none have ever beheld such beauty as this, Just as none have ever witnessed the descent of morning frost in the seventh month. (Herbad of Haravatat Tafazzoli's Remarks: The word in the first sentence, of which the meaning cannot be determined for the time being, could also be translated as "farmland" or "cemetery". Herbad of Vahumana Yarshater 's Remarks: Many thanks for your comments, Master Tafazzoli. Now we're even more confused as to who the author of this book is writing about.) ...Thus, the Mistress of Pushpavatika spoke: "Praise be to the Winged One , lord over all the kingdoms of the land." "I am a spirit created at the beginning , I am a flickering illusion, I am the shimmering light that flows from the eyes of the creator." "People in far-flung lands sing praises of your wisdom. I wonder then if you could help me to unravel something that has long bewildered me?" "I will give you these spices, gold, and precious stones as a token of my appreciation if you can solve my three riddles." That princess of (...) answered thusly: "Praise be to the Winged One, the truth that rules over all the kingdoms of the land." "I am the owner of yesterday and the master of tomorrow morning, but never have I seen beauty and elegance such as yours." "Mistress of Pushpavatika, whatever doubts you may harbor in your mind, you may raise them with me without reservation." "For these spices, gold, and precious stones, even when added together, cannot compare to the value of imparting knowledge." Vol. 2 A torn page discovered in the desert ruins and retrieved by researchers from the Vahumana school of the Akademiya. The author of this page has yet to be confirmed. Thus, the Mistress of Pushpavatika spoke again: "Benevolent Princess, if your sincerity is true," "Then allow me to recite the first riddle." "What is cold as the dead while alive," "Yet gives warmth upon death?" That princess of (...) answered thusly: "You speak of the fragile rose of late spring. Even when covered in thorns, her beauty shines through." "Her flowers plucked to make perfume, her stems snipped into the wicks of oil lamps." "Lovers throughout history have been smitten by her, and even the king in red admires her beauty." "But the rose has never pined for anyone. She merely withers with the new moon and morning dew." The Mistress of Pushpavatika secretly approved, yet her beautiful face remained as calm as ever. Taking a casual step forward, she recited the second riddle. So said the Mistress of Pushpavatika: "O wise Princess, you have answered my first riddle." "But from the stars to the abyss , many inexplicable secrets still exist in the world." "O wise Princess, if your wisdom is truly as the legends of the people say," "Please answer my second riddle as you did the first." "What rises from the earth, then descends from the sky," "No one has seen it, yet it sees all," "As above, so below, and as at the bottom, so too, the top," "Yet only top to bottom may be, and never bottom to top?" That princess of (...) answered thusly: "You speak of the universal law created in heaven , the divine laws established in the beginning." "No one has seen the eternal law, yet it governs all." "One may only bow down and worship Vaana of the heavenly spirits — no arrogation, deception, or trickery is permitted." "If one dares to imitate the forbidden arts, only calamity awaits at the edge of divine knowledge ." Vol. 3 A torn page discovered in the desert ruins and retrieved by researchers from the Vahumana school of the Akademiya. The author of this page has yet to be confirmed. The Mistress of Pushpavatika almost jumped for joy, but her beautiful face remained cold. Bowing ever so slightly, she recited her third riddle. Thus said the Mistress of Pushpavatika: "O wise Princess, you have grasped the secrets between the stars and abyss." "But there are more things in this world than the transient — for some things are eternal in their brilliance." "O wise Princess, if your wisdom is truly as the legends of the people say," "Please answer my final question as you did my second riddle." "What cannot stop arrows, yet can stop destruction," "Cannot destroy armor, yet can destroy cities," "Does not submit to envoys from above , nor kingdoms down below ," "What can neither gods nor demons, for all their might, prevail over?" That princess of (...) answered thusly: "You speak of endless wisdom, it is what protects the civilization of (...)." "It will be reborn with (...), and remain eternal like (...)." "Even if the sands of time swirl beneath its feet, it will still remain like (...) ten million years after." "The people will rejoice because of its (...), and it will (...) because of them." (Herbad of Haravatat Tafazzoli's Remarks: The omissions here are not intentional. Instead, they are due to the damaged state of the book. Some omissions can be inferred from the remains of the original. Regrettably, the researchers of Vahumana who undertook the translation of this volume did not possess the relevant knowledge, so I will make up for that in part. The missing word in the first segment: "Mine (Ours)," "Eternity," or "All," The missing word in the third segment: It seems to be a person's name, but the phrase "preserved remains" can be inserted too, The first missing word in the fourth segment: "Return," or "Death," or "Rebirth". The remaining words cannot be inferred at this time. Herbad of Vahumana Yarshater's Remarks: ...You didn't tell me any of this at the time, huh?) The princess had answered all three riddles, and no secrets could stymie her. The Mistress of Pushpavatika could not help but feel utmost admiration toward the princess. Thus, the Mistress of Pushpavatika spoke: "O benevolent, wise, and eternal Princess," "Your wisdom does far surpass the legends." "Blessed are your kin, fortunate are your people," "For they can be by your side, heeding your teachings." ...And so the two princesses forged a strong alliance, and also with the king of (Blood? Resentment? Red Crown?) who was by their side from beginning to end. They worked together, leading the people of (...) to eternal prosperity.The Tale of Those Without Shadows Once, this land was home to a group of a people without shadows. They led simple lives, knowing nothing about the world outside the place where they lived. This lasted until one day, when a lost adventurer discovered them. The shadowless folk were shocked to find that the adventurer had a lockstep attendant, silent and loyal. The adventurer, too, was shocked to see that people lived in the world who would not cast a shadow because of the sunlight. "Never in my wildest dreams did I think that I would make such a discovery," said the adventurer. "Dreams? We have not had those in a long time," said one of the shadowless people. "Our elders tell us that all dreams have already been dreamed." "Shadows hide the secrets of the soul. You have no shadows, and that is why you do not dream," said the adventurer. "Perhaps you did once have shadows, just like you once did dream." "If that is so, where shall I go to find that which I have lost?" "Go to the secret forest. Many dreams dwell there, and perhaps those who capture dreams there may have some extras to share with you." And so, the young shadowless person left his homeland behind, traveling far off to visit the secret forest the adventurer had spoken of. This forest was filled with layers of shadows: the shadows of the clouds, tree canopies... Even the tiny birds cast large shadows over the soft soil.Day after day, he passed between the crisscrossed shadows. Shadows hide the soul's secrets, he thought, and perhaps he was the only one here without any secrets. And so, one day, he discovered that all dreamscapes were open to him, for he had no dreams, but it was because of this that he could enter the dreams of others. In the many dreams he witnessed, the birds dreamed of vivid colors, the tiger of fragrant scents, but he did not see those who capture dreams, nor did he discover the excess dreams that were spoken of. The dreams, the shadows, and the beings that dwelt here could be matched one for one... and so he wondered if the adventurer had cheated him, and if there really was no such thing as a masterless dream, just as there was no such thing as a shadow without a source. But just as he was about to admit defeat, the one who captures dreams found him. Their encounter happened within the dream of a seashell. He barged into its ending, searching for the white waves and the salty wind, but neither was to be found in its saddened aftertaste. "Just like this shell, you do not belong to this forest." The speaker was a woman, and he quickly realized that she was the dream-captor spoken the adventurer spoke of, for her shadow had a strange, mottled texture, like drapery encrusted with gems. "I have been looking for you," he said. "Perhaps you have some extra dreams..." "They pass like the morning dew..." She said, and there was no sadness in her voice. "Masterless dreams cannot last long. I have tried many times, but they always dissipate in the end." "...See, just like this seashell... We must both leave." Taking his hand, she led him from this fading dream bereft of white waves and salty winds. Beside a murmuring brook, she told him a great many stories, and taught him how to enter dreams. After that, she warned him multiple times concerning the taboos of the dream-captors, such as how they should never gaze repeatedly into another's dream, for their secrets are like a bottomless well. "The nightmares are more cunning than you can imagine. Once they discover what you have done, they will arise like a swarm and drag you into the darkness. You will not be able to leave that place, the boundary where no shadows are. If you wait long enough, you will be able to make out meaningful words, names that linger in faded memories that no longer belong anywhere. And you know that you must not speak the names of the dead, or they will seek you out..." "I once believed that none of you had shadows," he said honestly. "I once believed that dream-captors did not have their own dreams, which is why they collected those that belong to others." The woman did not reply, her mottled shadow swaying in the night wind like a leaf. But the young shadowless man was too eager for the answer, and though the dream-captor defended the shadows well, he found his chance nonetheless. Unlike the dreams of the forest beings, whose dream-gates were wide open, it was a rugged path that led to the dream-captor's dreamscape.It seemed evident to him that she had hidden her secrets in others' dreams, he thought, but what were her secrets? And whose dreams were these? The dream-captor's dream was many-layered, just like the secret forest, and so he lost his way, and before he knew it, the nightmares were upon him. "I have broken the dream-captor's taboo, but even if I can see that bottomless well, I cannot find my answer," he thought. "She said that if I stayed long enough, I might able to make out a name from their voices. At least that way, I will know whose dream this is." And so he allowed himself to be led into the depths, and just as the woman had warned him, it was a boundless, lightless realm. He listened then for the tiny sounds, hoping to find words that could point to a name. An unknown period of time passed before he finally heard a name amidst the scattered sounds. This sound had a strange, special attraction to him, and he could not help but recite it. Then he opened his eyes. "I saw a strange sight," he said. "I saw that a woman had entered my dreams and stolen them, stolen secrets of my soul that I didn't know existed, and since that day, I no longer had a shadow. And I heard her say this, and she called me..." "You know," she said, interrupting him, "that one should not speak the names of the dead, or they will seek you out..." The dream-captor sat by the murmuring brook, her mottled shadow swaying in the night wind like a leaf. "That is but a tale about the dead. I have told you such tales before, but there are many more that have yet to be told." And so the dream-captor continued to tell the young man with no shadow a story that none have yet heard... Vol. 2 The Tale of the Dastur Once upon a time, there was a Vahumana Dastur who traveled alone into the desert depths to investigate the ruins of ancient realms. Unfortunately, he encountered a sandstorm and lost his way. But just as he was about to breathe his last, a young woman with amber eyes appeared before him. She parted the howling sands with the staff in her hand, and led him out of the desert. It was already noon by the time they reached the village. She treated him to lunch at her home and offered to escort him back to Caravan Ribat . But, having seen her part the sands as if by some spell, and how she had chased the dark beasts along their path away, the Dastur refused to leave, instead asking if she could teach him the secret arts of ancient lands. The mage replied that her amber eyes could see all that the living and the dead had seen. People without shadows, a bronze clock whose pendulum swings by the power of imagination, whales that have never left land, a city that only exists by the reflected moonlight upon a silver mirror, a scholar imprisoned within eternity, a high tower hanging upon seven strings. She could see that he had infinite potential and a boundless future ahead of him, and she was indeed willing to teach him all she knew. She had but one worry — that after learning all, he would seek his own profit and come to deny her. The Dastur knelt to the ground and kissed the tip of her shoes, promising that he would never forget what she had done for him no matter what, and that he would never deny her, even if they should then die together. His earnestness touched the young mage, and smiling gently, she helped him up. Holding his hand, she brought him to the door to her basement, saying that she would indeed take him as her disciple, and that all her secrets were hidden in her underground library. And so they walked down the winding stairs, level after level, with a mirror hung on the wall of each level, reflecting their faces and the feeble light of lit sconces. They walked for who knows how long — perhaps several hours, perhaps several minutes — for the darkness had obscured their sense of time. At the end of the stairs was a narrow gate, and behind the gate was a hexagonal library. He could not see the ceiling, nor could he estimate the height of this room, but the books in here nonetheless far surpassed all he imagined was possible for knowledge. He learned well under her tutelage, but after a few weeks, envoys from the Temple of Silence would come to the Dastur and tell him that his mentor had passed on due to illness and that owing to his thesis passing review, the Akademiya had decided to make an exception for him and promote him to Herbad, that he might take over from his mentor and continue to educate more students. The newly-appointed Herbad was greatly pleased, and yet he was unwilling to leave yet, and so he carefully asked the mage if she could bring some of her books and come with him to the Akademiya, and there continue to teach him. She agreed to his invitation, but said that she had a sister who had always longed to learn at the Akademiya but was ultimately not accepted due to her desert heritage. She thus asked if the Herbad could take her own as an auditing pupil. The Herbad replied that the Akademiya had a strict testing process and that he could not make exceptions, not even to take someone on as an auditing pupil. The mage for her part said nothing more, simply packing her bags and following him to Sumeru . Several years later, the sage of Vahumana passed on. Thanks to the earth-shaking theses he had been able to write and complete with the aid of the mage, it was unsurprising that the Herbad was recommended to become the new sage. The mage went to congratulate him, and asked if he might take her sister on as an auditing student now that he had his position as a sage. The newly-appointed sage rejected her, saying that he had no duty to do this, for he no longer needed her guidance, being someone who no longer needed to write theses. He advised her to return to her village and live out the rest of her days in peace. The mage said nothing more, and packing her bags, she returned to the desert. Several years later, the Grand Sage too passed, and the Vahumana sage was selected to take the post. Hearing this news, the mage came hurriedly from the desert. Finding him, she knelt at his feet and kissed the tip of his shoe, reminding him of the promise he had made her and begging him to take those of her tribe who had been displaced by the sandstorms in and allow them to have refuge beneath the rainforest bower. The Grand Sage was furious and threatened to hurl her into a jail of bronze and leave her to die of starvation and thirst, for he did not know this charlatan of the desert wastes, and who was she, anyway, to coerce the Akademiya? The mage, no longer young, lifted her head, wiping the tears from her cheeks, and looked upon the Grand Sage one last time with her turbid amber eyes. She begged that she might be allowed to return to her village and help her tribespeople. Refusing, the Grand Sage had his soldiers bind her. And so the mage said little more to him save only this: "In that case, I must ask you, sir, to return to your own village." The Grand Sage was startled, and when he had lifted his head, he found himself standing before Caravan Ribat. The night had grown long, and the distant village could no longer be seen clearly, shrouded as it now was in flying dust and sand and night's own cloak. The young woman stood before him, smiling, and her amber eyes reflected how he appeared at this moment: the Dastur of Vahumana, whose thesis had yet to pass review. "Well then, the hour is late, and you should return to the Akademiya now. After all, just as the stories say..." Vol. 3 The Tale of the Prince and the Sumpter Beast Long, long ago, when Port Ormos was still ruled by the seafaring Deys, there was one valiant Dey amongst their number. He was the subjugator of countless isles and domains, thus obtaining many curious treasures and becoming second to none in wealth throughout the port. Yet the mariner's life had left him time for but a single son in his latter years, and passed away before the prince would reach adulthood. The Dey's son had inherited his great wealth, but had no power over those his father had administered. Guided by elders who lacked moral fiber, he quickly began to live the life of a sensuous animal. The prosperous streets of Port Ormos were like a beast that swallowed gold, and so the Dey's inheritance was emptied by the princeling within a few years, even saddling him with a massive debt in the process. By the time the prince came to his senses, the walls of his home were bare, with not a single Mora to be found within. After selling his estates and dismissing the servants, the prince, with nowhere to go, sought refuge at a shrine to an ancient patron god of mariners, which through the patronage of his father in turn had attained its current august stature. The prince asked the shrine's priest for aid thusly: "Wise elder, I was once the son of a Dey who conquered the seven seas, but see, I have fallen this far due to my unconstrained extravagance. I beg that you have mercy upon me and show me a swift way through which I might clear my debts and ransom my estates. I promise that I will change for the better and become a man who knows his place." "Young prince," the priest said, "the fates of mortals have long been ordained by the gods, but they must accomplish those fates themselves. Since you desire to turn over a new leaf, should you not begin through hard work rather than relying on opportunism?" The prince quickly replied, "my father was a great patron of this shrine, so if we must argue, half of the golden statues and indeed, your expenses, should belong to me by right. And am I not here to claim this debt I am owed?" "Arrogant prince, will you make an enemy of the gods?" The priest said with a sigh. "Yet on your father's account, if you shall promise to keep to your place and manage your finances well, I shall tell you how to become wealthy." And so the prince swore to upon the divine statue, and the priest directed him to a street market at the outport. Coming to said market, the prince met a woman dressed in great finery tending to an emaciated Sumpter Beast. "Esteemed lady," the prince asked, "is there anything I might do for you?" "You've come at a good time," the woman replied. "I must go out to sea on an urgent errand, and I fear that there is no one who can help me take care of this beast. But if you will aid me, I shall return in three months and pay you ten million Mora ." The prince was overjoyed at this. "But," the woman continued, "you must not feed this beast till it is full, nor can you speak to it. Otherwise, even that which you own now, you shall lose." "And what have I to lose?" The prince thought to himself, and thus agreed readily. The woman then entrusted the Sumpter Beast to him. Three months passed quickly, and as the woman requested, not once did he completely fill the Sumpter Beast's stomach, nor did he speak one word to it, until the final day. On this day, the prince, excited at the thought of his soon-to-be reward as he sat before a fire, spoke to the Sumpter Beast, "O good Sumpter Beast, it is thanks to you that I shall be rich again. If you have a request, name it, and I shall satisfy you." Hearing these words, the Sumpter Beast cried, "O honored prince, I have no other wish but to have a full stomach on this last day." Hearing the Sumpter Beast speak, the prince was greatly shocked and allowed his curiosity to take over, forgetting all about the woman's instruction. Turning around, he brought water and hay from the feeding trough. "My most gentle prince," the now-full Sumpter Beast said slowly, "I was once a god who served the heavens and ruled over many vassal kings of the desert, but I was cheated by that venomous witch and forced into this form. If you will have mercy upon me and release me into the desert, I swear upon the king of the blazing sun that I will grant you riches beyond counting, more by far than what that witch can give." The prince felt dubious about the Sumpter Beast's words, and so he decided to hide it, and then conceal himself in a corner to await the woman's return. She did indeed return the next day, only to find both prince and Sumpter Beast missing. "Faithless wretch!" The woman cursed. "If I catch you, I shall seal you in the smallest magic bottle I find, and there you shall face eternal torment!" Seeing her thus, the prince finally believed the Sumpter Beast's words. Once she had left, he prepared to release the poor animal. As it was about to leave, it said to him, "O merciful prince, may all the desert gods defend you — I shall fulfill my promise to grant you endless riches and happiness. I ask only that you do not ask where they came from, or else, you will lose even that which you have now." Following the Sumpter Beast's directions, the prince came to a hidden place at the edge of the desert, and there he did indeed discover a mighty and luxurious palace. Its walls were decorated with gold and gems, and its gates were made of pure gold, with a lovely male servant leading many lovely ladies out of those great doors to receive him. And thus did the prince once again lead an opulent life. Each day, the male servant would bring him silver, gold, pearls, and gems. Rare delicacies and fine wine were his to enjoy, and each day brought unique dancing girls to keep him company — and such was his life for three years.But even in merriment and revelry could boredom be bred, and one day the prince woke from days of drunken stupor, and he thought to himself, "I tired now of my life today, and am in need of new thrills. Now, was it not because I refused the instruction of the witch that I gained this life of mine? Who then may say if that Sumpter Beast did not hide something from me for fear that I might discover his secret? If I can find the source of this limitless wealth, surely greater happiness still shall be mine." And so the prince summoned his faithful servant, and said to him, "my most loyal servant. Could you tell me of the source of the gold and gems, wine and spirits, and even these musicians and courtesans, that you bring before me each day?" "Of course, my respected master," the manservant replied. "Each day, I traverse the lands between the desert and this place, and all that you enjoy is drawn thereof. Your lovely dancers were once swaying desert eels , the glittering gold are the endless sands, and the gourmet meals you enjoy are of my own personal make." "And I, your loyal servant," the manservant paused, "am naught but a humble scarab ." Just as he finished speaking, the glorious palace dissolved in an instant, and the prince found that he was seated upon a squat sand dune, and there was nothing around him apart from crawling insects. After a long while, he regained his senses, and even through his shock and terror he felt the hand of grief and regret. And yet, what he had now lost could not easily be regained, and the prince was at last reduced to wandering, never to feel happiness again. From then on, he would tell anyone who wished to hear him speak this story... Vol. 4 The Tale of the Researcher Once upon a time, there lived a researcher, upon whom all the hallmarks of the haughty man of letters might be seen, though he himself — and we shall be generous to him here — was not the best amongst his peers. Knowledge is like a fruit, after all, and time quickly whittles its freshness away. If he cannot eat it all while it is still juicy and full, the rest shall taste like sweet decay. "Time," the young researcher said, "you truly are my hated foe — even more so than I consider my colleagues." Alas, innate characteristics such as laziness cannot be so easily shaken off. Thus did winters turn to summers and back again, bringing his "hated colleagues" glory and praise, while he was left with the scars of the bygone years. Perhaps this was some trick of fate, but our main character would indeed discover a way to make his wish reality — quite by accident, in fact. "Time seems fair, though it is but a veneer. That I am not as quick-witted as others is not due to a lack of talent. Nay, 'tis but the cruelty of time..." So thought the researcher, now no longer young. "Now that my chance has come, I must use it well." And so he made this wish to the injured Jinni : "I wish for time to be just... so that I might write better theses." The Jinni understood him quite easily, saying: "All things come with a price." "Well, yes, and I have clearly paid part of that toll," he said, shrugging. "I have wasted my youth on pointless pursuits. Now that things have come to this point, I no longer desire common joys. I only wish to leave behind a work of stunning brilliance, that my name will be praised for generations. Nor do I wish for my work to be left on perishable ink and paper, but it shall instead be carved into stone. Thousands of years on, my marks shall still be left upon this world... and this way, I shall have my justice — I shall triumph over time. "If that is your will," the Jinni replied noncommittally, fulfilling the researcher's wish nonetheless. But whether that was truly a Jinni or some demon in disguise was quite the matter of contention, especially in hindsight. Leaving this matter aside, the researcher whose wish was fulfilled found that everything had now become slow compared to his thinking. "Good, good. Now then, my agility of mind shall not be a problem." At first, the researcher was most pleased. Now that he had ample slack, so to speak, there was much time for thoughtful consideration. The time it took for a sand grain to fall to the earth was not sufficient for him to raise his left hand to touch his forehead, but his mind could sprint during this time — from forest to desert, from vast plain to snowy tundra it could run indeed. He cursed that all the pages of a book could not be laid out flat, but had to be flipped one by one. But even had they been laid out before him, his eyeballs would have failed to move quickly enough. By the time his eyes had finished resting upon a single word, he would already have exhausted all vocabulary related to that word, and all imagination pertaining to that vocabulary. "I think too much and write too little," the researcher thought afterwards. "I must use the most elegant words to write the most academically rigorous paper." But when he had penned the first word, his thoughts had already leaped to the conclusion. And so he had to constantly repeat the essay to himself, and as he silently dictated the text, it would become more and more refined. Yet, this could only happen in his mind — when all was said and done, his right hand had yet to even write seven words. And thus was this great work, comprised of the finest lexicon and the stoutest logic, compromised by the researcher's own body. Every passage came out tattered, as if someone had shredded every page and put them back together haphazardly. The words that were connected felt like fragments randomly selected from a complete text, and no one could really grasp the connection between them. It was on a starless night when he, with all his strength, like one completing a centuries-long exodus, managed to leave his study, arriving at the courtyard downstairs. "Perhaps speaking shall be more direct than writing," he said, a single bare thread of hope remaining in his heart. But his very voice seemed to stumble after the weave of his thoughts. His syllables came out disjointed and fragmentary — as if the intent behind the words had changed even as they were being said, and so they came out as mere mumbling and whimpering. "Alas, poor old fellow! One might almost think he has been possessed!" So said the well-dressed young folk who looked upon him with sympathy. "But at least he still has the moon." They left after saying these words, leaving the researcher alone in the moon-bathed courtyard, trapped in the prison he once called a body. Then the mere husk of a mortal man began to recall a story that he had once read... Vol. 5 The Tale of the Mirror, the Palace, and the Dreamer Night after night, she would always dream about that distant palace. Its intricate structure was formed of infinite corners, arcades, and passages, and at each corner would be hung a silver mirror with a gilded frame. It was said that the king spent 200 years (6 years more must be added if one wishes to follow the numbering of years in those days) to design this place, and when seated upon the throne, he could gaze into any mirror, and through its exquisitely planned and winding paths of light, one could glimpse any corner of his realm. Yet when she looked into the mirrors at the ends of the hallways in her dream, all she could see was a blurry image: that of a masked young woman garbed in fine raiment, wearing lovely ornaments, walking through the opulent corridors, like a heat haze in the flaming gold of day. She knew then her purpose, though it might seem strange — she wished to gain an audience with that king and tell him something, for these words had been put into her heart and were not hers to command, though she would always leave those words somewhere in the warping mirror-lights each time she awoke with a start. Year after year, in her dreams as clear as dawn, she would try — and fail — to find the way to the throne, nor would she ever witness that king in person. The young lady who was once lost amongst the mirrors was now a famed magician, and even so, in those stolen dreaming moments, in those flashes of unconscious lucidity, those fantastical thoughts still had her soul in their iron grip. One day, the great mage discovered clues to reaching that distant kingdom at last. Forsaking all that the worldly might hold dear, she set out on her journey alone. Across mottled moonlight she sailed, through the shadowed valleys she strode, and the darkest forests she braved, until she, at last, reached that realm of her dreams. But alas, alas! That city had been annihilated in a terrible fire a few hundred years ago, and the once-prosperous kingdom was now no more. It is just as the poets say: The morning breeze is forgotten by all, Song and color have faded from sight. Only the dim gleam of towers tall, Lights the ruined, barren night. She entered the devastated palace and walked amidst its ruins. The mirrors and their gilded frames had long been shattered, with naught but their shattered wrack remaining, each splinter reflecting a beam of chilling moonlight. The court was not as bizarre or strange as it had been in her dreams — in a few mere corners and a few corridors, she was knocking on the door of the throne room. It was a circular hall with hundreds of mirrors hanging from the stone walls — though like the mirrors in the hallways, these had also mostly been destroyed. The mage subconsciously walked towards that long-vacated throne and sat down, casting her gaze upon one of the still-whole mirrors. In that mirror, she beheld again that masked young woman garbed in fine raiment, walking amidst the opulent halls, and behind her, the mirrors — mirrors that had never been shattered — reflected a thousand reflections of her form. She startled and raised her head, for that young woman now stood before her, silently watching, unimaginable pain in her eyes. The mage had only just thought of something to say when the woman drew a dagger — before stabbing her in the heart. A lustrous rose-bloom graced the silent tip of the blade as flames ignited all around them, consuming the hall that had once been destroyed by a great blaze once more. She smiled in confusion, astonishment, and relief, for the woman then took her mask off, revealing the features of the mage herself, dry lips quivering ever so slightly. This time, the mage could finally hear the other person's words — words that had become lost across the decades and centuries within this labyrinthine dream and its eventide bewilderment. It was a story, a story told by her to herself, a story reflected in thousands of shattered slivers of silver, echoing on and on, forever... Vol. 6 Tale of the Bird Chaser This is a story of an old bird chaser. North of the kingdom lies a dense forest. It is home to a flock of birds that can mimic the words of humans . They often gather like a cloud by the break of the dawn. As they fly in the forest iridescent hues dance on their spread wings, and their chatters echo round the tree crowns. But these creatures are not alone, for an old and frail man dressed in tattered rags always comes and spends all day chasing after them like a savage. Just as how a towering tree was once tender and delicate, the old man used to be fair and handsome. He grew up in a village by the forest. Agile and kind, he was much-loved by all. Every girl in the village adored him, but his heart fluttered only for his love, a young priestess serving in the forest who always fascinated him with miracles of the divine. The young man often thought that he would give up anything to be with the girl, until death did them apart. Alas, that which is sweet never lasts. A grueling war broke out, and the young were conscripted, including the man. Before he left for the battlefield, he saw his love weep for the first time. Teardrops rolled down her cheeks like dew falling from a green leaf — then down into his heart. Yet little did he know the actual reason behind the girl's melancholia. He made hasty promises, wishing to ease the girl's sorrow — one caused by departure, as he then naively believed. With grief written all over her face, the girl gave no response to his beautiful vows. After a brief silence, she said she would send talking birds to relay her words of longing. It was an unusual use of power, but the young man took her act as a means to secure his love. So he nodded. The young man departed the next day to honor his duty to his kingdom. It would soon be over, he thought. But reality eventually proved him wrong — the war dragged on and on. It was not until stubble grew on his chin and his eyes and hands became battle-hardened that the dust finally settled. His only solace in this brutal war was the birds from his hometown. As if guided by the gods, they always managed to come to him on quiet nights, carrying her words — the whispers of her bitter-sweet longing, telling him of changes in the village, or of a few short verses she wrote him. The sustained separation had not diminished his love for her. Instead, if love was a monument, it would be driven into his heart. When the war finally ended, he hurried home to propose to his beloved, only to find that she had died of an acute illness on a cold night shortly after his departure. The young man refused to accept it, for he had just been visited by a talking bird the previous day, when his young priestess read him beautiful prose through its mouth. He broke into the girl's closed chamber. But as the sunlight filled the dim room, it stirred what was inside: countless enchanted birds waiting to be awakened from their rich slumber. In a single instant, the birds rushed past him, wings flapping by his ears, and flew through the open floor into the sky like an ethereal cloud, returning to their home. At last, the young man stood alone, his love's empty room before him. It finally dawned on him why the girl had made the most unusual arrangement with that saddened expression on her face the night they parted. It had been an arrangement for a lifetime — on her dying bed, she must taught the birds countless words, more than enough to fill his every night since with a flicker of light. Birds live far longer than humans think. From that day on, the young man has been chasing the talking birds in the forest. In their voices, he seeks to catch her lingering soul, to repent for his sin of scattering her love in the woods. Maddened yet tireless, the young man has not stopped his chase for a single day as he turned into a middle-aged man, then aged into an old man. The talking birds now speak of nothing new, and their numbers have dwindled. But what if there is still one that he has not yet met — one with something from her that he has not yet known? The obsession traps the bird chaser in the forest and upon his face is written the toll of years. He skillfully sets up traps very catch the birds and keeps them in a cage, stroking their necks, playing with them, and giving them the best cereals and clearest water. Then, he will say to them, "Speak, Talking Birds, speak of my love, who the forest favored so dearly. Speak of what she taught you." And so, the generously-fed birds will tell such a story...A storybook containing various lore and tales authored by Marie Hericart de La Fontaine, most of which were not written by the author but are compiled from ancient poems which have since been lost. The Maiden and the Sun The adopted daughter of the fox grew to be of marriageable age, her face as gentle as a beautiful spring. Delicate and polite was she, and none could name a lady better.Therefore, the fox said to her daughter, "My girl, little girl, I am standing in my grave. I may soon no longer be able to care for you as I once did." "Please, choose a husband for yourself. All would be honored to be the one." The daughter replied, "If it shall be so, Mother, please have me wed to the most powerful being in this world." "Ah, and that would be the sun," the fox said. "My son-in-law you shall be, O sun shining in the sky." "No," the sun refused. "These clouds are more powerful, for they block my radiance." "So it is, then. Flowing clouds, those who block the sun's radiance, please marry my daughter." "Oh, that won't do! The wind blows me away so easily. You're better off entrusting her to the wind!" But the wind was stopped by a mountain, and so the fox went to it. And the mountain demurred, citing conflicts with a mouse. That mouse, when enraged, could bore a tunnel through the mountains, Thus, it was mightier by far than the mountains, was it not? The mouse suggested the cat, the cat the dog, and the dog, the wolf. After having gone through the entire cycle, the Fox found herself facing the sun once more. As thus did the young beauty marry the sun. The story tells the truth that one should accept their destiny, instead of making excuses and trying to evade to the end. No matter how honest, or how cunning, one can never escape the duty one ought to shoulder. Vol. 2 A storybook containing various lore and tales authored by Marie Hericart de La Fontaine, most of which were not written by the author but are compiled from ancient poems which have since been lost. The Crow and the Fox Once upon a time, a crow perched on a tree, a piece of stolen cheese in its beak. Seeing the crow, the fox living under the tree looked up and said, "Listen, my friend." "The thing in your mouth is no enticing feast," "But a source of misfortune that anyone sane would avoid like the plague." "Look at your throat and then back at the cheese. Are they matched in size?" "Swallow it, and you might just lose your life." "The cheesemakers of the city have only let you go," "Because they know this — or do you think they've handed it to you for safe-keeping?" The crow cared little for such words, and continued holding onto the cheese. Seeing that the crow did not intend to give up yet, the fox spoke up once more: "My friend," "This cheese is not some valuable delicacy!" "Think! When you glided between mountain and forest, free of heed or care," "Did you then hear of something called cheese?" "If you would listen, I would say that such a thing was never meant for us to enjoy." "Let it rot in the mountains. Let the wind carry it into the sea." "Better that than to let it become a shackle that binds you." The crow fluffed its feathers, but kept its hold on the cheese. Seeing that the crow still would not give up, the fox sighed. "Come on, my friend," "If you truly must savor the taste of cheese," "I, a mere fox and bystander, shall not stop you." "But surely, you must not know how cheese is best consumed." "If you were to simply swallow it willy-nilly," "It would be a terrible waste of such a rare treasure!" "Alas, and such a waste it would be, too, of all the recipes I have spent time gleaning from the lands around the world!" Suddenly curious, the crow could not help but open its mouth. "And could you teach me such recipes?" Even as it did so, the cheese fell to the ground, And the fox snatched it up, before turning tail and burrowing into its nest. This story tells us how those who seek to discover mysteries that they should not know, Shall lose all, even that which they already had. Vol. 3 A storybook containing various lore and tales authored by Marie Hericart de La Fontaine, most of which were not written by the author but are compiled from ancient poems which have since been lost. The Tale of the Donkey Even when dressed to the nines, a Plain Jane will rarely be mistaken for a socialite. Everyone in this world has strengths and weaknesses that are theirs and theirs alone. Thus, the only way forward is to know oneself and face one's own flaws. Don't be like the donkey of this tale, and make an ass of oneself. Having learned how the fox seized the cheese, the donkey sought to emulate the crafty fox. "Why is the world like this?" "The fox is no genius. Why do others always toot her horn?" "Do I, the donkey, not labor every day? Yet, no one cares to even greet me with a smile." "Since this is the case, I shall learn from the fox and do the same as she." "Her little tricks, surely, shall be mine in no time." Thus, the donkey hid among the trees, and waited for its target to come by. As the daughter of the cheesemaker passed by, the donkey bounded over, And imitating the fox, raised a hoof and said with a smug voice, "Ha! Listen to me! You know nothing about swift travel." "Just throw all your cheese away. Shall your cart not arrive sooner that way?" The young lady was shocked, and she immediately replied, "Oh, you silly donkey! You dare to try to pull my leg?" "Get me my stick! I'm driving this beast back to the mill!" Seeing the stick being waved at it, the donkey ceased speaking at once. This tale explains how trying to be someone else and smothering your own identity, Is by no means beneficial. Indeed, it only leads to more suffering.It is said that the great scholar Pulteney wrote this epic historical work concerning the ancient Remurian civilization in the early years of the founding of Fontaine. The ocean gave birth to all, yet also devoured everything. Legend has it that in the first era , the earliest peoples were self-supporting in their virtue, needing no laws or authorities. The envoys of the heavenly city walked the earth, and with their guidance, the people enjoyed enduring peace, prosperity, and abundance from the ancient days. This Heaven-blessed reign lasted countless generations until people grew tired of their inscrutable eternity. Their offspring ceased to listen to the oracles. Instead, they desired things never promised to them by the divine, trying to break free from their fate. Enraged by their behavior, Heaven sent gigantic waves to smash the settlers' cities. A hundred days of rain came afterward, and the roaring tides drowned all sin and arrogation, and thus were the early peoples brought to an end. When the tide receded and the earth was revealed again, no cities nor civilizations now stood above the high waters. Survivors and the newborn alike lived amidst the forests and rivers, shorn of all knowledge and wisdom. Human lives were no different from those of wild animals on the earth or in the sea, driven on by the laws of nature — muddling through time with neither beginning nor end. Untold years passed. The throne of Gurabad was established and overturned in the far south, and the noble kindred of the east once reached the rim of the high waters — all while our ancestors remained bound by ignorance and superstition. Civilization and order were finally restored to the land named Fontaine the day the great king Remus descended upon Meropis in his golden Fortuna . He taught people how to farm and raise crops in the land, and built temples and cities with giant rocks to house the people. Most importantly, it was he who spread the beauty of music and art, which differentiated humans from other living things, causing them to see themselves as masters of all things. With his immortal fleet, Remus conquered all the islands on the high waters . Even the great dragon beneath the abyssal depths submitted to his power. Those were the best days since the end of earliest peoples, and eternal prosperity seemed so near at hand. The God King and his people indulged in the sweet dreams of carefree lives and fantasies of never-ending progress. However, the seers prophesied discord: "The greatest empire will face the most utter destruction, and this is Fortuna. " Thus did the God King derive the primordial plan from the seven-day rotation and the flowing winds of sea and land, and composed a harmonious symphony of prosperity. He believed that so long as all the cities echoed with this greatest of songs, they would escape the judgment of fate and at last reach the land of eternal bliss. But thusly do the ancient writers concur — "Oceans will rise, empires will fall, and the only constant is change." Vol. 2 It is said that the great scholar Pulteney wrote this epic historical work concerning the ancient Remurian civilization in the early years of the founding of Fontaine. Greatness and glory unto Remuria , and its immortal ruler, Remus, king of all under heaven and universal Harmost. Today, the glamor and luxury of the bygone Eternal City is beyond the imagination of even the most knowledgeable scholars. As you sailed past the Ocean Pillars along the royal fairway to the giant port playing host to Fortuna the imperial ship, you would have first seen a lofty tower. The tower of Remuria was not built to receive heavenly oracles, but to guide ships traveling between islands in the high waters. It is said that the tower stood at the border of reality and dreams. Even if sailors were to be lured into slumber by sirens, they could follow the sound of the bell to break through the mist and find their way to Remuria. Continuing along the royal fairway leading to Machimos , where the brave Remurian warriors lived. The grand temples and arenas were built with giant carved rocks to commemorate the city's glory and victory. The solid and towering walls are decorated with glaze and gold, bronze and marble statues arrayed the land, and gold, spices and specialties from the world over piled up in the markets. Traveling through Machimos, you would arrive at Capitolium , the center of Remuria, overflowing with delightful aromas and beautiful melodies. It was a paradise for artists, where only the most outstanding intellectuals and musicians were allowed. Even among them, however, only a small fraction enjoyed the privilege of serving the God King. Here, all the theaters and palaces were established in shapes most harmonious, their beams and domes adorned with the most sumptuous and intricate carvings, and centered on a golden palace of towering copper pillars. The King, resting peacefully at the heart of the palace, listened closely to every melody and every note coming from every corner of the empire. Upon hearing any discord, the God King would correct it immediately with a pluck of his strings, bringing perfection to the symphony of his empire. To keep all the people upon the high water from destroying the symphony of universal harmony, King Remus promoted four humans of great capability to high post. He shared his power and authority with them, making them his partners in governance, the Harmosts for all cities, to eliminate all discordant sounds. To spread the harmonious symphony throughout the world, he built far-reaching fairways , which conveyed the melodies as never-ending ripples from Capitolium to every corner that sat above the high waters. Yet fate's decree was not for even such as gods to defy, and to even attempt to escape destined judgment was a mortal sin. Amongst the God King's sins, the most terrible was the attempt to pass power that should have been reserved for the godly domain to humans. Thus, this power and status led to corruption and decadence, leading to violence and revolts. Such is fate's cunning that it uses the very powers that rebel against it to its own ends. When the day of destiny arrived, Remuria, the grand immortal city, faced an inevitable end. Today, the God King's melody is played only in Capitolium, and his mighty reign has ended. Thusly do the ancient writers concur — "Oceans will rise, empires will fall, and the only constant is change." Vol. 3 It is said that the great scholar Pulteney wrote this epic historical work concerning the ancient Remurian civilization in the early years of the founding of Fontaine. Humans, in their naivete, once believed that the reign of the King Remus and his Eternal City would surpass time and fate to last thousands of years, just like the giant rocks comprising the ringed ritual sites. Until that day, when the earth collapsed all at once, the tall tower was uprooted, and drowned in the titanic waves alongside the great hall of pillars. Until that day, when the royal fairways and temples were reduced to ruins, and the city, along with its residents, warriors, intellectuals, nobles, and even the golden palace, as glamorous as the shining sun, fell into a chasm of eternal darkness . That was the moment when the absurdity of their "eternity" finally dawned on them. Glory to our Noble Navigator , the Ruler of Rivers and Seas, and the Queen of All Waters. May she defend the law, and may her reign be long. Peace be upon all the realms of Fontaine, and all the people under the heavens. When the royal city collapsed, the great power shattered, and the people above the high water were perched on the precipice of barbarism and annihilation, it was our noble Queen who settled the conflicts between the tribes. Around the flowing springs we established cities new, and started a world guided by laws that has endured to this day. The tragedy of Remuria occurred merely a century ago, but its history has already become concealed in legends and superstitions. This does partly come down to the fatal catastrophe that destroyed it — so ruthless and swift was the disaster that all the researchers and literature capable of passing down said knowledge now sleep beneath the waters with the Eternal City. Another key reason is the purposeful distortions created by the mysterious researchers who claimed to be descendants of Remuria. My job is to extract and reproduce the true, essential shape of this magnificent ancient civilization with the universal rationality of history. In certain folklore that exists today, even the greatest of ancient scholars have been painted as soul-stealing magisters who entrapped mortal spirits within specially-made magical golems , binding them into service. To be sure, the Remurians did make such terrifying golems, which to this day may be found, ruined, out in the wild. But this may only be blamed upon the moral degeneration that came upon them in Remuria's latter days. Its people had forsaken their noble duties and embraced hedonism and debauchery, accepting the violence they inflicted on others — and thus were they also violently destroyed. Just as the ancient writers concur — "Oceans will rise, empires will fall, and the only constant is change."How the emissary of King Remus came to Erinnyes , asking her for a gift of Aremori Castle's water and earth, and for her to submit to the Sumphonia Capitolii (which means "the eternal harmony"). Chapter 6 Part 7 How the emissary of King Remus came to Erinnyes, asking her for a gift of Aremori Castle's water and earth, and for her to submit to the Sumphonia Capitolii (which means "the eternal harmony"). Of the glorious deeds of Otkerus of Rhenanie, a righteous and noble knight , and his valiant battle against a venom-breathing dragon, Much has already been said earlier that we shall draw to a close here. Now, we shall look back and talk of Erinnyes in those days. At the time, Erinnyes had just defeated the princes of Bellouacoi, Atrebatis, and Uiromanduoi, and accepted their allegiance. And so the residents of those lands knew of the kindness of the Mistress of Many Waters , submitting to her rule with sincerity. To celebrate that fealty and wisdom, eight days of feasting were ordered in Aremori Castle, with all to be treated as honored guests. On that day, a musician arrived, an emissary dispatched by King Remus of Capitolii , claiming to have a message to deliver. He came with no attendants or guards, just a single horse, and a golden-tipped fasces as a symbol of his status. Everyone present was deeply displeased, but the emissary was permitted to speak out of respect for Erinnyes, the beloved leader of the knights. On seeing Erinnyes, the emissary first wished her well and performed a formal bow, before explaining his intent. "I represent the most honorable and greatest King Remus, emperor of all, and send my regards to your court." "May your anger never destroy your powers of reasoning. King Remus asks of you two gifts, as legitimate tribute." "The first is water, for the purest of waters can wash away all sins. The second is earth, for dense earth can resist the erosion that looms." "King Remus expects you and your people to honor his wishes. Should you dare resist, death shall be sure to follow." The emissary's message sent Sir Guillaume of Gellone into a rage, and he drew the sacred blade Narbonnais from its scabbard. "Cease, you braggart! To make such threats on this occasion is an insult to every knight here." "And if you mean to threaten my sworn liege, there is no need for me to hold back. I shall have your head, sir, in a single stroke!" More of the brave knights drew their swords, including Knight Blancandrin and his compatriot Knight Marsile. But the wise Knight Erinnyes gave an order to the knights present: the emissary from Capitoliani was not to be harmed. "Please, tell King Remus, great emissary, that in this whole world, there is only one to whom we bend the knee." "And that is the beneficent Mistress of Many Waters, our mistress, who bears for us our sins, the greatest and most honorable ruler." "No other ruler or god can be spoken of in the same breath, for she is greatest in kindness and first in glory." On hearing that, King Remus's emissary again spoke, saying this before all gathered there: "Before King Remus conquers your land, he shall send war or hunger or plague upon you." "Those who once fought against each other have been brought to peace under a single ruler, and this is wisdom." "For otherwise, who shall mourn when the waters flow over our heads? And who shall save us in our hour of need?" "Of all these braves, who has rescued themselves from ignorance and superstition? Who hears the cries of the weak?" "King Remus's orders are well-meant and born of pity. He does not wish to see a single person fall into the waters. He would see all saved." Vol. 2 How the Knights of every region united to lend their strength to Erinnyes, in opposition to the designs of the Capitoliani to invade. Chapter 6 Part 9 How the knights of every region united to lend their strength to Erinnyes, in opposition to the designs of the Capitoliani to invade. When Sir Agricane had finished, the fine bowman Knight Drest, Prince of Lyonnais, was first to speak and offer his view: "The harmony and prosperity that Vivarium's heir has promised us are naught but lies, his promise but trickery." "Knight Erinnyes of the Lakelight, none so wise and noble as you should be taken in by such pretense." "You must know that those words are aimed much like a poisoned arrow tipped with gold. It may be dazzling to watch, but the pain it brings shall be all the greater." His fair companion, Adsiltia, the lady of the azure sail, whose name meant "daughter of ice," was next to speak: "Vivarium's heir is the least trustworthy of traitors. That he would have such harmonious congress with Boethius is completely bewildering." "Knight Erinnyes of the Lakelight, no matter what reason he offers, we cannot let the Capitoliani harm all we know to be good." "Please, make up your mind as soon as you are able, and do battle with the court of the Capitoliani. For there shall be no salvation for our souls should you bend the knee." "Let the evil disappear like dew in the sun. Oathbreakers and the unjust will be driven from this world." "And in this way, songs will be sung of your wisdom, for those who seek to exact the debt of bloodshed will be remembered by those in misery." And following that, Sir Naimes, Sir Tulpin, and all the other noble knights lent their swords to the fight. Erinnyes knew of their dedication and offered her sincere thanks. Then she met with King Remus's musician and spoke to him as follows: "Please inform King Remus, noble emissary, that we are not bound to bow before any monarch." "The Mistress of Many Waters has granted us all equal honor. There are none greater who shall trample me, none lesser who must envy me." "And I am to lead her blessed army to destroy the white dragon and the grand city , and to cleanse their bodies in their own blood." "Like a herder drives the wolves from his flock, I will drive the invaders from this land, to serve as an eternal warning." And with that, Erinnyes ordered Sir Fierabras to prepare wondrous gifts for the Capitoliani musician. She also ordered the emissary to be escorted back to Carubdis Castle so he could report to King Remus. Of that, we shall write later. Vol. 3 How Erinnyes bid farewell to the Mistress of Many Waters, and how she threw her sword into the lake three times. Chapter 20 Part 3 How Erinnyes bid farewell to the Mistress of Many Waters, and how she threw her sword into the lake three times. The Mistress of Many Waters heard all this and, in her eternal kindness, compassion, and grace, granted Erinnyes her wish. And so Erinnyes said: "Thank you, O Queen of Many Waters, for showing me the Pure Grail I so urgently desired, and for allowing me to complete this journey." "Those knights who yet survive, your servants, will continue to loyally serve you and your future kingdom, following that noble musician ." " They will pursue the lingering shadows, restoring justice. For those who travel in the dark yearn for the light, while those in the light know nothing of the dark." "Goodness is nothing but a dream. Thus do I present these good knights to you and beg that you forgive their sins." The Mistress of Many Waters heard all this and, in her eternal kindness, compassion, and grace, granted Erinnyes her wish. And so Erinnyes said: "O Queen of Many Waters, I confess to you my sins and do not hide my evil, for they are too grave to be forgiven." "In your high and pure ideals, you must not forgive such sins. The only possible comfort for my soul is expulsion and exile." "There are no angels or divine edicts. In your kind and loving land, only sin may determine sin, and only people may judge people." "I ask only that you remember my suffering and witness our grievances. For these are like disease, like a poison." "I submit my name into your hands, and may all who criticize us be cursed for all eternity for their lack of righteousness." The knight with sea-colored eyes finished her speech and drew her shining sword. A beam of watery light shone from it and lit the valley. "Oh fair Hauteclaire, Sword of Light! How you shine under the blazing sun's beams!" "You have drunk the crimson blood of the unrighteous. Oathbreakers and the unjust have fallen like flakes of snow to the ground before your purity." "Countless sins stain my coat, for I bear the guilt of bloodshed. I have taken lives, even that of the righteous, yet still you shine." "May the Mistress of Many Waters have mercy! The unrighteous are not worthy of you. Beautiful and holy Lakelight, I return you now to the lake!" Thus did the knight with sea-colored eyes cease speaking, and she threw the sword in her hand to the waters of the lake. Yet the sword did not sink and drifted back to her feet. "Oh fair Hauteclaire, Sword of Light! You are so lovely and sacred, your golden hilt inlaid with jewels." "Daeira, that maiden by the lake, that noble lady of pure waters, gifted you to the chief of knights so she could perform countless deeds." "She once used you to conquer Peiregord; she once used you to defeat Aisias. Even the fae of the distant south could not seize you." "May the Mistress of Many Waters have mercy! The unrighteous are not worthy of you. Beautiful, holy Lakelight, I return you now to the lake!" Thus did the knight with sea-colored eyes cease speaking, and she threw the sword in her hand to the waters of the lake. Yet the sword did not sink and drifted back to her feet. "Oh great Hauteclaire, Sword of Light! By your blade were so many conflicts settled in peace, and the ravages of war laid to rest in these lands." "One day there shall be one nobler than I, seven times more so, who will lift you again, and they shall do deeds seven times greater." "How many wondrous days have I spent beside you! Ah! Dawn breaks, yet I have lost the crown of righteousness forever." "May the Mistress of Many Waters have mercy! The unrighteous are not worthy of you. Beautiful and holy Lakelight, I return you now to the lake!" Thus did the knight with sea-colored eyes cease speaking, and she threw the sword in her hand to the waters of the lake. The sword sank without a trace. And then she left with the spirit who had been by her side from the start, never again to be seen by any in this world.A short fairy tale that is quite popular in Fontaine. Many children saw the exquisitely drawn cover and thought it was really written by the kind Madam Snow-Winged Goose of legend. Pers the Penguin Legend says there is a sea of ice far off in the south. That is where the penguins live. Penguins are chubby little ladies and gentlemen, with tuxedos of black feathers pulled tight over their cute white bellies. You might think they look awkward on land, waddling about, unable to fly like other birds. But just you wait. You'll see them throw themselves onto those bellies and slide as if snowboarding, right into the water. With a splash, they become elegant and talented swimmers, their thick, flipper-like wings helping to streamline their bodies as they zoom about underwater. Now, lots of children already know these penguin facts. And children who love penguins will know all this by heart. But there is one thing that even the penguin-loving children don't know. Every penguin in the world comes from outer space, far beyond the skies. Great flocks of penguins once flew across the universe, their flippers steering them between the stars, their sleek feathers reflecting what little starlight there was out there in the void. From red giants to white dwarfs, from the shoulder of Orion to the glimmering Tannhauser Gate... The penguins explored it all. The penguins remember it all. But, perhaps because of some interstellar catastrophe or even a simple family argument, several penguin clans split off from that galaxy-roaming flock and landed in the icy waters to the south of Teyvat. They became our first penguins. But those new arrivals found our atmosphere too thick to fly in, and their lack of prior experience with water left them unable to swim as well. Until, that is, the birth of the marvelous Pers the Penguin — the first penguin to learn to swim. Like many young penguins, Pers would gaze up at the starry night sky, or the blue skies of daytime, and say to himself: "If only I could fly, like my ancestors!" And so Pers decided to learn from the birds. How did they fly so high? First, Pers the Penguin asked the biggest bird he could find: a frigatebird. And the frigatebird said: "Haha! Piece of cake! Once you bring me 30 fish, I'll spill the beans!" And so Pers spent 50 nights on a moonlit beach, collecting 300 shells. Then he found a whale who liked shells and exchanged his 300 shells for 30 fish. The next day, the frigatebird swallowed those 30 fish in one great big gulp before laughing and flying away. As he flew off, he called down to young Pers: "The secret to flying is to be light! Why not try losing some weight?" Well, losing weight was easy enough. But if a penguin lost its thick layer of fat, it wouldn't be a penguin anymore. So, Pers shook his head. And as all children know, the frigatebird got a new nickname after all this for its greed and unreasonable nature: the piratebird. Next, Pers asked the seagulls for help. But all they did was squawk and croak. Pers was thus none the wiser, and the seagulls wound up having a big argument. In fact, some of them became so angry that they refused to fly ever again, becoming auks... Though that's a different story. And so Pers asked a petrel for help. But the petrel would only teach him some impractical tricks, and not the basics that he needed most. Because, that noble seabird thought, surely it was better to learn how to soar through a stormy sky than to worry about trivial matters like taking off and landing. Pers was now a very disappointed penguin. He waddled back to the beach and gazed out across the peaceful nighttime ocean. And as he did so, he noticed for the first time ever that the stars of his celestial homeland were reflected in the ocean. And he found them so beautiful that he simply... jumped in. And, after a brief moment of panicked sinking, Pers the Penguin realized that he could fly — underwater, at least. He could whizz speedily along, or twist and turn. It was, after all, what those strong wings and that smooth round body had been made for! And that is how Pers the Penguin became the first penguin to learn to swim. And after Pers, many other penguins plucked up the courage to take that leap into the waters and, like their ancestors, soar amongst the glimmering stars, exploring, feeding, and playing. Once Pers had shown them the way, the penguins took to life in the water and forgot their spacefaring past. Not even in their dreams did they remember that limitless void. The penguins live here now, between sea and land. Vol. 2 A short fairy tale that is quite popular in Fontaine. Many children saw the exquisitely drawn cover and thought it was really written by the kind Madam Snow-Winged Goose of legend. Princess Marcotte In the not-too-distant past, every type of plant and every type of beast had its own kingdom. And in the Marcotte Kingdom, there live a princess with long pink hair. Legend has it that she was born in a crab claw and never put down roots — she always was, and always would be, a tough little seed. "My darling daughter, my beloved treasure. Why not settle down and enjoy a life of nobility? Why do you wait so long to sprout and grow?" asked her worried and kingly father. "Father, father, please do not fret or rage. I was born in a crab claw, and that claw will be my ship. Your daughter's fate is not to take root in the mundane earth and grow pretty flowers. It is to conquer the seas and explore a new and wonderful world!" The king was shocked by his daughter's plans. What was wrong with pretty flowers, he thought? Wasn't he a pretty flower? And what if his daughter one day decided to set down those roots and grow an even prettier garland than his? That would be terrible. But he only felt this way because he was ashamed of not being as pretty as he wanted to be. And so, he had the princess and the crab claw locked up in a golden box. Then he hid the golden box in a mirror made of purest water. And then he threw the mirror into the sapphire lake of the Pluie Lotus Kingdom. There was only one way to reverse all those layers of confinement and free the princess (and the crab claw) — to make the Mother Lotus laugh. And as everyone knows, Pluie Lotuses are all too used to weeping. "All is well again," said the king. "I can rest my regal head in peace. All I need to do is wait and wait, for my beloved daughter's seed to start to crack. She will lose her wanderlust. For what choice will she have, but to grow..." "And then my daughter will be like me. She will follow her destiny and grow strong and healthy." But the brave princess was not cowed by her long imprisonment. She wrote joke after joke to try and make the Mother Lotus laugh, and practiced telling those jokes over and over. The crab claw chortled. Even the golden box guffawed. But the Mother Lotus? Nothing. So she decided to write a comic play. She rehearsed until the crab claw couldn't help but burst into laughter and hop around — despite having no feet! She even converted the interior of the box into a theater. But still, nothing. Next, the princess tried to find comedy in the circumstances of her imprisonment — situational comedy, she called it. Soon the crab claw was, like the princess, laughing until it cried and then crying until it laughed. And eventually, the Pluie Lotus — keen criers, as we know — found themselves giggling. Finally, the Mother Lotus could contain her curiosity no longer, and the princess was granted an audience. And, to everyone's surprise, the princess didn't even need to tell a single joke. The Mother Lotus burst out laughing as soon as the princess entered the room. Her laughter grew louder and louder, shaking the palace walls and sending ripples across the sapphire lake. Princess Marcotte won her freedom. But she won something more valuable as well — the ability to laugh, and to make others laugh, even in the saddest of circumstances. In her crab claw ship, the princess sailed the ocean waves on her voyage to the new world of her dreams. And ever since, sailors have told tales of a crab claw ship. Vol. 3 A short fairy tale that is quite popular in Fontaine. Many children saw the exquisitely drawn cover and thought it was really written by the kind Madam Snow-Winged Goose of legend. Mr. Fox and the Clockwork Guardsman A long, long time ago, Mr. Fox and the Clockwork Guardsman were good friends. Mr. Fox was a successful thief. The Clockwork Guardsman was... well, he was a guard. Clue's in the name, isn't it? But that was a long, long time ago, of course. They're still good friends, though. That will never change, no matter their jobs or social status. The Clockwork Guardsman had always had a worry curled up inside him, and as the years passed and his mechanisms aged, that worry got bigger and bigger, like a balloon, and heavier and heavier, like a piglet, and it was always there no matter how much he tried to shake it off, like Mr. Fox's lovely tail. It was a very worrying worry. So the Clockwork Guardsman told his good friend, Mr. Fox, of this concerning concern: "I've already lived a very long time. I've met so many people and said goodbye to so many. I've heard the funniest jokes and lived through the saddest times, and then I've forgotten it all and lived through it again. Even though forgetting isn't easy for a machine such as myself, it all fades." Mr. Fox understood his friend's concerns and knew just what to suggest: "If living such a long life makes you forgetful and jaded, perhaps it is time to die, and in doing so, to make your life real." "But, my fluffiest of friends," the Clockwork Guard said, removing his alloy guard's cap and sighing, "didn't you steal Death from Ms. Toad's dressing table in that heist many years ago? It caused quite the commotion, as I recall. The living things of the world all forgot how to die." As, we all know, Ms. Toad is Death's envoy, the queen of all that is ugly, cold, and annoying. She guards that coldest jewel, Death itself. "Ah, I was so young then. I remember I was madly in love with Ms. Jackal, and I wanted to bring her the most expensive treasure I could find." "And?" "I succeeded. But she died." Death slipped from Ms. Jackal's hand and shattered on the ground. The fragments melted into the earth, never to be seen again. And as that happened, the creatures of the world started to die as normal once more, with all that should have been dead now being so. Except, that is, for Mr. Fox, who should have died, but didn't. His life dragged on. "Death still exists in this world! All we need do is search for it!" And so Mr. Fox and the Clockwork Guardsman, furry paw in cold metal hand, left the city they called home to search for Death in all the corners of the world. And they searched and they searched and then they searched some more. They searched until Mr. Fox's beautiful red coat had turned white. They searched until the Clockwork Guardsman's pride and joy, his official guard badge, had rusted. Finally, they reached the place where Ms. Toad lived. "Ms. Toad? Ms. Toad?" called the Guardsman, as he knocked on the door. Ms. Toad opened the door slowly and stretched out her warty, scabby hand. "Lovely Ms. Toad, I am so sorry to bother you again," said Mr. Fox as he took off his hat. "But my good friend is in great pain, and you are the keeper of the only cure." "Ms. Toad is of course aware of how lovely she is," came a rasping voice from within the ramshackle hut. "And if your friend seeks Death, he will not find it here." "Life is not tea and Death is not sugar. Their tastes cannot be distinguished if you live forever. But you have a mechanical heart and a mechanical tongue, and have tasted their flavor over and over, during each cycle of activation and deactivation..." Ms. Toad removed an embroidered shroud to reveal the cold jewel called Death, then extended a hand, beckoning to the Clockwork Guardsman. "Come, young guard, come, child. All must be tested, but do not admit defeat easily, my strong child..." "My maggots will not eat you, my moss will not grow on you. Whether your enemy is time or guilt, sadness or ennui... Do not admit defeat easily, my child." And with that, Ms. Toad took the guard's metal hand and placed it lightly on the jewel called Death, and he saw how long, long in the future, he would end— After countless years of hardships, a battered and beaten Clockwork Guardsman was thrown into the fires of the scrapping plant, to melt into a metallic ocean of millennia of waste. All those slow metal thoughts and hard metal ideas became swift and liquid. They evolved and combined and formed a new life. It was a glorious return for all metal lifeforms, making even the release of death fade in comparison. And so the Clockwork Guardsman saw the future and gave up his dreams of dying. His good friend Mr. Fox, meanwhile, withdrew his thieving hand and left the jewel where it was. Indeed, life encompasses more than just bitterness akin to tea. If he had a friend to accompany him through the hard times, what rush was there? He could steal this extraordinary jewel later. Later, as all children know, Mr. Fox and the Clockwork Guardsman lived long, long lives, until the little world they lived in was but a desert, until the sun went out, until the moon fell... And even then, their story didn't end. It lived on, passed from world to world.A series about conspiracy, revenge, justice, and evil that took Fontaine by storm. ... An old man with gray hair carefully stood six special musket rounds on the table, looking at the brother and sister before him with his nearly blind eyes. "Six bullets. Will they suffice?" The old man asked. "They will," said the brother. The old man sighed. He had kept his promise, teaching the two orphans he had found at his doorstep everything he knew. Swordsmanship, marksmanship, deception... How to infiltrate a mansion and not be spotted by the hounds, how to kill someone in their sleep without leaving a trace, and how to pull the trigger without hesitation... "Six bullets, six lives..." The old man said to himself. "No," said the sister, "five lives." "Two of these are for the same person." The old man didn't say anything. He didn't ask why they chose him, and he didn't ask how they planned to carry it out, just like how his teacher hadn't asked him all those years ago. But the old man cared about his students. His nearly blind eyes had seen more than anyone in the city. "Revenge is a one-way street, children," he said, "what you've learned from me is enough for you to live a rich and meaningful life." "I don't want you to end up like me. Just look at my eyes — divine punishment, meted out to those who seek revenge." He tried to open his cloudy eyes for them to see. "We died twenty years ago," said the brother. "If we don't fire these bullets at those who deserve them, then we cannot return to the land of the living." The old man stopped speaking. He had known this day would come when he took them in. "Alright... I will not try to persuade you any further." He supported himself with his arms and stood up. Lately, even something as simple as standing took a toll on him. Even so, he wanted to go around the table and hug his favorite students. He knew that this was the last time they would see each other. The old man asked, "Do you need anything else?" "No." said the brother. The old man noticed that the sister frowned. He couldn't see it, but he felt it. "What is it, Iris?" the old man asked. He always liked Iris better. While she was considerate and passionate, she never hesitated when she had a gun in her hand. Iris looked at the flowers outside the window and said, "Actually, I have another request." "May I pick a few of your Rainbow Roses?" ... —The Two Musketeers, pg. 224. Vol. 2 A series about conspiracy, revenge, justice, and evil that took Fontaine by storm. ... "This is it." Two muskets pointed at the Baron's head. The sound of the blood dripping from one of the guns served as a countdown for the noble's life. "Splat, splat, splat..." "Useless trash." The Baron cursed in his mind while staring at the guards on the floor behind the two shooters. "I paid them so much money... for nothing!" "Do you know who we are?" One of the shooters asked. "So what if I do?" "You can tell the judge of hell who sent you there." The storm washed over his face, eyes, and ears, but the sound of the dripping blood was crystal clear. Splat, splat, splat... "...I know who you are. Iris... Tulipe... My children." spoke the Baron. He was done resisting. On this stormy night, crumpled on the muddy ground, he was tired. Tulipe spat. "How dare you call yourself our father! I wonder what the look on your face was when you killed Mother twenty years ago — when you forced her to take poison." The Baron sighed and closed his eyes, recalling what had happened then. To his surprise, it was effortless. Her eyes emerged suddenly before his eyes. How could he not have fallen in love with her? Her wondrous silhouette, her melodious laughter... From one room to the next, she had stolen glances at him. Her brown eyes, deep as a serene lake, shone like the night stars. How could he have turned her down? "Will you marry me?" Looking into her eyes, he could not say no. How, then, could she betray him? Why had she asked for more, thinking that he would elope with her? Splat, splat, splat... "She asked for too much..." the Baron said, opening his eyes. "Mother never asked for anything. She just wanted to live a quiet life like everyone else," Iris argued. Blood dripped from the grip of her musket, but her hand did not tremble. "She asked me to give up my wealth and run away with her!" the Baron roared. He was sure that his children didn't understand the idea of wealth and power. "She asked you to give up your vanity, and give her true love instead, just as you had promised to," said Iris. "You would have made the same choice were you in my shoes!" "No," said Tulipe with conviction, "we would not kill our loved ones for wealth and power. Only the devil is capable of doing that." The Baron shook his head. He no longer wished to argue. Splat, splat, splat... "What is the point of this?" he asked himself and the shooters both. "You lost your mother, and you're about to kill your father. What else will you have left, besides your crime?" Iris and Tulipe looked at each other. There was no hesitation in their eyes. "Justice." Two shots rang out, like thunder roaring through the night. Every drop of rain shivered in shock. They stood in the rain, unmoving. The storm battered the city, but nothing was louder than their silence. After a long time, Iris took out a Rainbow Rose and placed it on the Baron's chest. Then, falling into her brother's arms, she wept. The rain washed away her tears, and the mixture flowed freely into the earth, toward the realm of the dead... Then, her body suddenly shook as she grabbed Tulipe's clothes. "What's wrong, Iris?" "Look." she pointed at the Rainbow Rose she just put down. It bloomed quietly in the dark, as vibrant as the Baron's blood. "Mother's favorite flower... is blooming." —The Two Musketeers, pg. 358. Vol. 3 A series about conspiracy, revenge, justice, and evil that took Fontaine by storm. Number 65, Ooze Avenue. The wooden door to a tavern in a cranny of this city of sin was kicked open with a bang. The loud chatter stopped, and patrons put their drinks down to look at the uninvited guest in the pouring rain. The muscular man was dressed in black from head to toe. If it weren't for the candles in the tavern, one would think that it was the heavy darkness of the night that had forced the door open. The intruder turned slightly. The brim of his hat covered most of his face, showing only his sharp chin. He looked around, almost as if wondering why he was here. From his relaxed posture and relieved breathing, patrons could speculate that he had either accomplished something very important, or just carried out some revenge... And, at that moment, he just wanted a drink. He walked toward the bar, and the raindrops on his coat followed him like loyal spirits. His boots thudded with every heavy step taken, leaden with unbelievable, crushing conviction. "Give me something strong," said he, with a voice low enough to shatter wine bottles. The owner poured him a glass reluctantly, then looked at the door and wondered how long it would take him to wipe the boot-print off. "Thank you," said the man, "I just accomplished something great alongside my sister." "Well, where is she?" The owner asked, deciding to make some small talk. "She went to plant flowers. I gave her all my money because she's always wanted to do that." "How will you pay for your drink, then?" The man seemed taken by surprise, as if he had never considered it. "Guess I'll pay with this." The man tossed a black musket onto the bartop with a thud. The patrons next to him spilled their drinks in terror. Everyone held their breath. "I'm not taking that." The owner feigned calm as he replied, but quietly, he reached into the drawer under the bar, where he hid a pistolet. He wasn't sure if he could fire faster than the man in front of him, though. "Don't worry, it just fired its last and most important shot, and it will never be used again." The explanation done, the man downed another drink. The owner caught a glimpse of the man's face when he raised his head. It was a handsome face, with a high nose, some scars, and sad black eyes. The owner withdrew his hand from the drawer. This man wasn't here to cause a scene. It was almost as if he had been drunk even before entering the tavern. "May I have another?" the man asked. "You've had enough," replied the owner. "I know, but tonight was special." He didn't notice that the owner was trying to get him to leave. "How so?" "I just killed someone." The owner's hands froze. Coming from this man, it didn't sound like a joke. "It was revenge," added the man. "He killed my mother." "And who was 'he'?" "The Baron." "Nonsense." Now the owner was certain that the man was drunk. Everyone knew that the Baron was bad news. Many wanted to kill him, but none dared to risk their lives to try. "I suppose you could have missed the gunshot if your farts were loud enough," the man taunted. The owner looked at the man again. He had large hands and a muscular build. He seemed to have been through countless fights — no tavern scuffles these, but real fights that had put his life on the line. Something flashed across the owner's mind. He recalled the recent series of musket murders, where the killer always left a Rainbow Rose and struck on stormy nights... "No way... Are you..." Before the owner could finish, lightning struck beyond the wooden door, and a wild gale threw it open. Night flooded in, drowning the patrons like a tidal wave. When the candles were lit again, the man was gone, but he had left his musket behind. It stared everyone down in silence like some solemn god of death, staring into the night that belonged to it... —The Two Musketeers, Fin.The binding and layout are exquisitely made, but the actual content is all handwritten. Judging from the handwriting, there is more than one author. "Don't fuss about WHAT we're writing, the cover needs to look good! That's the only way it'll give off that 'masterpiece' feeling." This is the story of a little witch who journeyed far and wide to find the "undying fire." The story begins as such, in the westernmost part of the magic continent, where a young witch was undergoing her "Witch Certification and Final Trial." As per convention, one need only pass this trial to qualify as a true witch. The trial required lots to be drawn, and the results were completely random, a format which resulted in frequent accidents. But the magic continent was nothing if not firm in its adherence to tradition, and so, if you would believe it, they've stuck to the rules of drawing lots for trials since the very most ancient of times! There's a law in the outside world known as " Morphy's Law ." That's how you write it, right...? Anyway! It means that bad things you worry about happening are probably going to happen. And thus did a completely unsurprising surprise strike the little witch! Some little witches got very simple tasks: stuff like synthesizing the final solution to the material world, the Philosopher's Stone , or bringing back baleen from a titanic universe-roaming whale , or perhaps figuring how to get to a parallel universe to find a no-longer-extant grimoire lost to a great, ancient magical war... and so on and so on. But our main protagonist drew a topic of terrible, troubling tribulation — to find and bring back the "undying fire." Perhaps her honored teacher might have an opinion on this subject? Her teacher was just enjoying a most wonderful teatime with her friends, and she comforted her student. "It must be because you're fated to become a really great witch, so, your topic's a little harder than most. Unsolved mysteries are the most interesting, after all!" "Really?" "That's right. When you come back, I'll be sure to welcome you with a tea party, one lovelier than this one, even!" The teacher's friends whispered to her: "Hey now, isn't that a bit much? You obviously only made up that question because you couldn't be bothered to think up a real exam question. If such a thing even existed, we'd have perpetual motion machines by now, don't you think!? Couldn't you have done something else — you know, made her prove the Grand Unified Theory based on the Unified Electroweak Theory or something?" "Oh, don't you worry! Life is full of a great many lies," the teacher spoke brazenly, "and I did not lie, did I? I know that the 'undying fire' does indeed exist. That blazing star... Huh. Hang on, when did I see it again... Must've forgotten." The teacher spun around to her pupil, saying: "Ahem! Considering that your trial is indeed quite challenging, you shall have three times the normal amount of time to complete it! Hehe, I'll be rooting for you!" Vol. 2 "You're more than halfway through and you haven't even pushed the plot forward one iota! Why is it all about the setting!?" "And what would you know? Besides, this stuff isn't fleshing the setting out. It's elucidating natural science and other miscellaneous disciplines!" Deep in the woods, nighttime. The little witch soared upon her broom beneath the blood-green moon. Blood-green was regarded as a symbol of great change in astrology, though whether such change be for good or ill cannot be determined by any result. —Actually, that shade symbolizes the dominant race of this world, the Nephilim. They were the children of gods and humans, and so their blood, too, was the conflux between the red blood of humanity and golden, divine blood. And actually-actually, the green moonlight was the result of the moon's physical composition, the distance between the planet and its moon, atmospheric scattering, and other factors. Anyway, so the little witch was soaring upon her broom beneath the blood-green moon, and then, she met a young lady who claimed to be a "fortune teller." "I wish to become a witch's familiar," said the young lady. But before they could even consider that, the little witch had something to ask: "Can fortune tellers read the skeins of fate?" The fortune teller then explained the underlying principles. Put simply, it's something like this: In our world , the stars are the heavenly strings by which humans are bound. But in other worlds, the subjects of astrological study are the solar ecliptic energies, the various lunar energies of the satellites, the will-energy of the celestial rulers of the planets, the scattered interference energy of distant stars, and the dark energy that suffuses the pitch-black cosmos. Of course, it's not like these things don't exert influence on our planet — they have merely been greatly weakened by a giant sky-shroud . As such, astrology on other worlds is far more abstract than that which is practiced in ours. By the way, other planets refer to an actual celestial bodies as an "archon" and a theorized one as a "virtual." The planet the little witch was on was no exception. You see, we also call a will that comes down from the heavens an " archon ." They are normally planets that have sentient life on them, and they number seven, and therefore they are called the "seven archons." As for the virtuals, their number varies between one, two, and four. The planet the little witch was on may well have been one. And in the case of such a world, the "virtual" would be the "dark sun." &#91; Note 1 &#93; Astrologists and diviners are, in essence, performing weight calculations on the sky-shroud, the cosmos, and the "archon" and "virtual" celestial bodies, before deducing individual developmental tendencies from world to world. But the relative weight of the sky-shroud over our planet is just way, way too great, and so, investigating it already allows us to obtain very precise results. As for the world the little witch and astrologist were on, they would have to go through the entire formula. After the little witch finished listening, she was very impressed by the fortune teller's learning and technique. Now they could speak of the matter of familiarhood. To be a witch's familiar was to share in her magic, and with magic, one could peer into more destinies. That said, becoming a familiar could have unforeseen side effects — it was hard to say what might happen. Yes! That's what the blood-green moon means: great change, which can't be judged as good or ill by the outcome. See how it all comes together? We didn't go off-topic! "It is a shame that I am still not a great witch. I can't make you my familiar yet, " said the little witch. "I know of another way to establish a contract with a witch. It seems we must resort to using it," said the young lady. This was the night bathed in blood-green moonlight, and it was also, coincidentally, the witches' Night Carnival. By the way, the Night Carnival is an ancient, taboo ceremony. Legend has it that at such times, the witches' magical powers are at their apex. They hold rituals in secret, offering sacrifices and keeping the bonfires burning through the night. This tradition had been forgotten in the westernmost parts of the magical continent but, for some reason, it had been revived within the deep woods. Normally, this was an event that only great witches or figures greater still could be invited to, or invite others to attend. In practice, though, participation in a Carnival had a direct relation with a witch's romantic or marital status. In any case, for some totally unknown reason, the astrologist knew all about witches while the witch knew nothing about astrologists at all. The point is, they decided to go and check out the Night Carnival. Let's just go with it being a way to deal with the anxiety the little witch felt over not being able to find the "undying fire." Under the blood-green moon, the great witches danced around the bonfire. The little witch and the young astrologist hid in the shadows of trees that grew so thick that even dense clouds couldn't compare, and even the bonfire could not illuminate them. "We just need to wait till the day after the ancient, forbidden night of revelry, when the dawn light first breaks and the various great witches depart. "In the grey embers will be a flame that never dies. When a mortal takes this flame and offers it up, that is equivalent to signing a contract with a witch," said the young lady. "Does this method always work?" The little witch asked. "It's possible a witch could reject the contract, but witches do so love their spirit mediums, and I'm not afraid of becoming a fearsome creature," the young lady replied, her voice thick with yearning. "In that case, isn't this an 'undying fire'?" Dark thoughts came into the little witch's mind. "What if I took that flame for my own?" And so, under the blood-green moonlight, the great witches sang their song: "If all things a witch's opera be," "Then nothing true worth mourning would the world ever see." "Our festival has come to a fruitful end." "The story shall not stay its feet," "And every night hence shall also be the witches' night." A sense of shame surged forth within the little witch as she listened from the shadows — it wasn't out of worry that those present, great witches and greater still, might include her teacher, school principal, instructors, or anything like that. She knew everyone at her school, and she was sure no one familiar was present. By the way, while the official rules at the school she attended were lax when it came to governing teachers and their students, students of similar age would still be ranked against each other. Students of different teachers were also permitted to interact outside of classes. The creation of this system could be traced back to the rise of the Western witches, long, long ago. They did not shy away from exchanging secret hexes and rituals for their mutual benefit, which would also result in their swift rise in those days. Of course, the organization that the little witch belonged to was a direct successor of these Western witches. Also, this blurb definitely wasn't just added in here because I forgot about this worldbuilding earlier. Back to the story. She said to the fortune teller: "Since we have this opportunity, go bravely forth, then! Once dawn comes, take that fire. If you should be so unfortunate as to become a monster, I will give you a quick end. You will not suffer." As a gift to commemorate this friendship, the young lady gave her treasured crystal ball to the little witch. "This crystal ball feels joy for all known destined paths, and its heart breaks for all unrevealed tragedies. If you ever feel lost, allow it to be your oracle!" Actually, there's a story behind this crystal ball. It— Vol. 3 Some mysterious handwriting appears before the main text: "It's so rare for R to be in her right mind for a spell. Should she really be wasting the precious little lucid time she has writing this?" "Don't worry. For a witch, this is the most important thing." In her travels, the little witch encountered a group of people getting ready to kill demon kings. She decided to join them and go kill some demon kings. They told her: The more demon kings you kill, the greater your witch's power will grow. This is, in fact, true. Then, they encountered a mimic demon king. After this whole affair, the little witch would write a "Demon King-Slaying Chronicle" each time she hunted one. They encountered the mimic demon king in a run-down old house. At first, no one knew what was going on, assuming that the place had just gone moldy. After breathing the mold spores in, her companions turned into the following respectively: A shoddy-looking ancient robot (which the little witch found really ugly and not up to snuff when compared to alchemy ), a beautiful young maiden (this team member was originally male, leading the witch to initially wonder if this was some inversion of biological sequential hermaphroditism), and a pirate (she had no idea about this one). After some time, everyone in the squad developed identity disorders. Considering that her three companions appeared to be of the same species, they should not have exhibited such different natures, while the symptoms were, by contrast, so similar. The little witch discovered that the mold had its own consciousness, and had a power that allowed similar lifeforms to turn into their ideal state. She did not change because she was already very pleased with herself. The little witch decided to test the mold's unique properties. She tried ingesting parts of it, finding it to be edible and without any side effects. Thus, it might have been a miscategorization to call it a mold, but since the mold in blue mold cheese could also be eaten, she decided to continue using that label. Something worth noting was that after a chunk had been cut away, the other mold threads would immediately disappear. Possibly a sign of a rudimentary collective intelligence. To facilitate further communication, the little witch wanted to turn into mold — and so she did. As it turned out, the mold colony only sent strange biological signals that needed deciphering. Through repeated observations, it seemed that their level of collective intelligence might be lower than she had previously thought. In the end, the mold committed suicide. The little witch deciphered its way of communicating communications, and as it turned out, the colony experienced dissonance in self-perception and self-dissociation when it looked upon the little witch who had become just like them. The signals they sent had in fact been philosophical speculation "Who is me, and who am I?" Its intelligence was thus much higher than expected. Her friends recovered, and told the little witch that this was the mimic demon king. It was a species of demon king, in the same taxonomic class as standard demon kings but not in the same order . It was a shame. She wished she had a chance to observe more and make some more records. Then, they encountered a chipmunk demon king, which her comrades had claimed beforehand was also a species of demon king. It was classified as belonging to the same class and superorder as a standard demon king but was part of a different grandorder. The chipmunk demon king looked very fierce indeed, and the little witch suspected that this aggressiveness stemmed from behaviors acquired during the gestation period and while nurturing their offspring. Infiltrating its old nest, they found that it was male. One of her companions was eaten. It turned out that it simply had a bad temper. The little witch decided to report the findings of this investigation to prevent the tragedy from repeating itself. They attempted to feed the chipmunk demon king seeds to lure it out. They lost another companion in the process. It seemed that this creature was not a vegetarian at all. Her final companion fled. having deduced from the pattern of events thus far that he was next on the chopping block. This was an incomplete logical induction — both the process and conclusion were mistaken. Eventually, she used high-grade boar meat to lure the chipmunk demon king into a trap. The creature's fat and fur made it resilient to fire and freezing. Though she had never dissected one, results indicated that it also had an organ enabling it to breathe underwater. A complete vacuum was used to dispatch it in the end. It seems that it still required aerobic respiration. Many demon kings seem very powerful, but they all have their weaknesses. The same is true for alchemical lifeforms. Finally, the little witch had to face a standard demon king, a great demon king of the primate order. Vol. 4 Some mysterious handwriting appears before the main text: " Tsaritsa be good, how are there this many unresolved plot threads? Please, have mercy on these old bones, would you?" So, the little witch found the great demon king. I'm sure you all remember that killi— defeating more demon kings causes witches to grow stronger. As such, the little witch was actually already amazingly powerful now! The great demon king was simply no match for her. "Can you really kill a being that looks like a human and has intelligence?" Shouted the great demon king in desperation. "You're right. I didn't really intend to do anything to you anyway," said the little witch. "I've never forgotten that my goal is to find the 'undying fire.' Researching, observing, and defeating demon kings was never even a means to the end, but rather just the building of a basic level of power." Then, she used — sorry, I don't know magic or mysticism — some super powerful awesome technique to bind the great demon king, and brought it back to the largest nearby city. As a trainee of the Western witches who had come out to take her exam, she naturally had credentials that proved her identity. This provided her convenient passage through the many mortal kingdoms — such things were also proven to be immensely hard to forge, thus avoiding the possibility of any cliche plotlines. This actually presented the mayor of the city with a conundrum — ah yes, this is a good time to say that this nation was a loose confederacy. And since this was a mayor, there was no aristocracy or hereditary titles — for the handling of this great demon king was truly quite tricky. I'm sure you all remember that the dominant race of this planet was the Nephilim, a hybrid of humans and gods? Right! So, the race of great demon king is actually the demon king class, and so demon kings were thus a type of Nephilim. And of course, since they were the dominant race, this meant that Nephilim were on the whole much stronger than normal humans — and since this setting for this world has hybrids of humans and gods, this meant that it has gods too. And taking a step back, the Nephilim also had a certain degree of legal immunity — If they had killed 5 humans or fewer, they couldn't be judged by human laws, and had to be repatriated to Nephilim lands. And as it happened, this great demon king had only stolen and eaten several thousand boars and chickens each. So this was fast turning into a diplomatic and political issue. Of course, the mayor could just stick the Western witches with all the blame, but that would offend every witch on the continent. Plus, the mayor was also a good friend of the little witch. She would never do anything that would hurt the organization of witches as a whole. Following some diplomatic rhetoric, some policies to appease it, and an explanation of the pros and cons, the captured great demon king accepted that retribution should only be exacted on the party who had done the wrong, meaning that his ire was now narrowed to the little witch alone. But he could not defeat her, so that was the end of that, really. Finally, I hope everyone remembers that crystal ball, because the little witch's goals had become foggy at this stage, so she decided to take it out and have a look at it. Vol. 5 The writing here is practically a messy scrawl. Perhaps the author doesn't really write much, or perhaps something happened. A familiar face surfaced in the crystal ball. "This is your magic teacher speaking. The trial is over. You were unable to obtain your witch license." Vol. 6 "Is it still necessary to write this, the present moment being what it is?" "Allow me, then. Opportunities to return to this world are few and far between. Alice would think the same: If we don't continue, then everything would have been meaningless from the start." The little witch hurried to where her teacher was. She wanted question her teacher face-to-face about why the test had ended, and why she was not to be permitted to become a witch. She wanted to throw things to the ground in front her teacher — though of course, she would only chuck the ones that could survive the impact and that she could practically lift herself while avoiding her teacher's favorite teacup. Of course, should the situation warrant it, she was even willing to smash her own second-favorite teacup to show how serious this all was. After all, she'd bought that one herself rather than it having been given to her by friends. She valued such gifts as much as the friends themselves, and would never use them as part of an emotional outburst. " Octavia 's back. Go catch up with her." That was what her teacher said calmly the moment they saw each other again. In an instant, the emotions that the little witch had stored up, brewed, fermented, plotted, and rehearsed pouring out countless times vanished. Octavia was a good friend of hers, and a good friend also of the legendary old witch. Her home had been destroyed, but as she lacked the courage to fight back, she had taken up a life of eternal wandering. She had seen many worlds, and had told the little witch many tales about the sky beyond the sky. "The entire cosmos is going to die soon. Things peaked but not long ago, and are about to go south very fast." Octavia was sitting in a yard swathed in flowing sunlight, pouring tea into the teacups she and the little witch loved most. The little witch pulled a chair up and sat in it. "You returned so suddenly," she said, "we didn't even prepare a chair for you. You're probably sitting in the old witch's chair now." "Many stars across the cosmos have gone out. I do not know how much time is left," Octavia said, "so I wanted to come back to see you." "Is that why my teacher and the others stopped all the witch tests? Because you came back and told them this?" The little witch asked. "Perhaps. In such a world, all things lose meaning, and there is no longer any need for you to become a witch." "Then I shan't be angry at my teacher any longer," the little witch said. "But will you be mad at me? I caused you to lose your chance to become one," O said. "I will, if you never return after leaving this time," came the little witch's reply. "I'll go to the bedroom to get your chair." "I can just sit in that old witch's chair, can't I? She's too old to get up and come sit in it nowadays." "That's no good! That chair's hers, just as your chair's yours," the little witch argued her case earnestly with O. "To each person a chair. That way, even if they are not present, their memories will be seated still. So we absolutely can't use the wrong chairs." Octavia smiled helplessly. And by way of apology for interrupting the process of the little witch becoming a proper one, she gave the latter a piece of news: So "The 'undying fire' really exists. It may be found at—" Vol. 7 The binding and layout are exquisitely made, but the actual content is all handwritten. Judging from the handwriting, there is more than one author. "I have already found the meaning of writing xe2x80x94 that is to tell you : I do so wish you were here, too." As she was buffeted by the waves of time, passing through the vortex where countless causalities converged, piercing countless threads of the weave, she missed a great many things. Even the memorial of the great witch she had so admired ended deserted, without her in attendance. Whatever they were, the point is that the little witch passed through all manner of haphazard trials and challenges and nonsensical stuff before she managed to arrive before the old witch. Actually, it's just that the little witch didn't think those experiences were worth talking about, nor did she know why anyone bothered spilling so much ink about all that earlier stuff. When all's said and done, the most important things were the witch's tea party and the goal she was pursuing. In truth, she had already seen it before her journey began. In a sky as dark as a sack of coal — or perhaps a cavern, for as we all know, there is no difference between the two — there hung a star giving off a weak radiance, resisting the world's darkness as it encroached on every side. As the universe gradually grew dim, and all stars and stars known as suns were extinguished one by one, everyone agreed to call it the Star of Scorpio. The little witch remembered hearing about this during the witch's tea party, but she only remembered the name and nothing else. Anyway, the little witch came before the old witch, who was actually the Star of Scorpio, that which burned still, even at the end of all things. However, her flame was very weak now, barely a faint ember. The little witch held her hand, which had become as dry and brittle as a withered branch. She remembered that the old witch was once a little witch as well, with pale and tender hands that once elegantly held teacups. Those same hands had been used to bring forth much magic, kindling the flames on many worlds. The little witch said: "Looks like everyone doesn't want the flame to go out, and I get it. It can't be helped. The last time we said farewell — you were there too — the witches said that long-lived witches would lose many things as the years went by. Life, death, love, and hate would cease to have much meaning. But that isn't true. Those are just words they used to comfort the companions who departed before them. Witches, in fact, treasure every infinitesimal flame and light that shines in this dark world bereft of hope all the more. They hold even the shadows that these flames would cast dear. "You often said that you weren't our equal, but I've always believed you to be the cutest, most powerful witch amongst us. You often said that you left little behind, but the stories you left to us hold countless worlds. Even should a hundred years pass, or a thousand, even if the apocalypse that a certain astrologer witch worried about comes, even if all the long-lived witches die, the little light that emanates from these little worlds will not grow dim. That's right. You were the greatest great witch — far greater than us all. I miss you. Farewell." The old witch did not respond, for all that was left here was but an empty husk, no different from the many others that the little witch had encountered in her adventures — indeed, they were even made of the same basic material, with the only difference between those and this being the minuscule light of a flame. And so, the little witch took the flame that was burning the old witch and set out on her homeward journey. Anyway, let's stop the story here. The little witch's adventures would continue, though, for she had already decided to bring the old witch's fire across the universe, to light every last corner of time.A woven scroll that depicts the legend of the hero Traore , a favorite among the children of the Nanatzcayan . This is one part of the story of the Volcano Lord 's struggle against the people of the tribes. If we were to start from the beginning, the storyteller might have to spend seventeen days and seventeen nights by the bonfire to finish, and by the end, the children might have fallen into dreamland on account of the lengthy tale — no one would hear the best part of the ending. As such, let us skip some of the... Let's just call them "the parts less important to the listeners." Instead, let us speak of the Volcano Lord and the Shadow Pin that hangs above the Sulfurous Veins : Our story unfolds in a time when great beasts withdrew from this land, and when the empty Great Volcano of Tollan was occupied by the dark Volcano Lord. The Great Volcano was once the dwelling of great dragons, and on this matter little further need be said. But when they fled amidst the flames, their dwelling was seized by the devious Volcano Lord. No one now knows what said Lord looked like, but the tribal elders who saw it all say it was a black-and-purple giant with a salamander's form. In ancient times, some conflated salamanders with dragons, but nowadays everyone knows that a salamander is just that. Anyway, the Volcano Lord dominated the lands of Natlan, committing countless vile acts. It bathed in the springs of the middle sea, causing the People of the Springs to be filled with smog, and it blew a wind filled with sparks to the Scions of the Canopy . At its worst, it even swallowed the entire Collective of Plenty ! That would have been trouble indeed, had the Tatankasaurs and the tribe's warriors not breached its stomach while it slept and escaped. All in all, this being did every wicked thing you could imagine, causing untold suffering to the tribes. And on this particular day, it lay within the volcano, gazing at its dark form... and a new, wicked thought came to it. "Bah, it's just so dark down here under the volcano, even darker than a moonless night! I can't even see my own body." "I've heard that the valleys of the Children of Echoes to the east are home to countless gems. If I could swallow all those shiny stones, then my stomach shall shine brightly like the starry night sky even in the darkest of places." So saying, it turned about, having decided to do just that. But the Volcano Lord was far too large, and it missed his notice that a little Flying Squirrel had heard his words. The little Flying Squirrel hurried to tell the story to a flying Phlogiston Aphid . The Aphid flew on high and told all it knew to a grazing Long-Necked Rhino , who then told a Tepetlisaurus with whom it was best friends. This Tepetlisaurus, in turn, was none other than the Saurian companion of the Children of Echoes elder, Traore. And thus did Elder Traore hear of the Volcano Lord's plot to seize the gems from his companion. This was terrible timing for the Children. Their strongest warrior, their Chief Sundjatta , and his companions had followed the hero Tenoch to the island in the far west to halt the giant dark beast, and could not do battle against the Volcano Lord. And so Traore and the warriors guarding the tribe sought aid from their tribe's Wayob , for all within the tribe knew that the Wayob symbolized all wisdom and the greatest of souls. Under the Wayob's guidance, Traore came up with a way to resist the Volcano Lord, so he and the soldiers made ready, sure to inflict a crushing defeat on him. The Volcano Lord caused the volcano to belch thick smoke, hiding himself within the smog. It was with such fanfare that he drew near to the valley of the Children of Echoes. When he reached the Sulfurous Veins, he saw a tiny tribesperson standing there, as if long having awaited his arrival. This was Traore. Traore said, "O Lord, O Volcano Lord, long have we heard of your departure. Long have we believed that your majestic form should by right be adorned with our finest gemstones. For this, we have specially built a stone chamber , and placed all our gems within." Now, the Volcano Lord thought, how did these puny people know that he had come to take their gems? Nonetheless, he was a mighty overlord! What need had he to concern himself with such matters? Thus did he gladly follow Traore to the stone chamber, only to pause in confusion once he laid eyes upon the chamber. For the gate to the chamber was only human-sized, far too small for giant black salamander! "Is this the chamber?" The Volcano Lord expelled hot air in displeasure. "How am I to enter it?" "Alas, Lord, but our hasty preparation is to blame. For we are but puny humans, unable to construct great palaces to contain your magnificent form. But you may still reach your hand into it — the treasures are there for the taking," Traore said. "But I cannot see what is within, you sly little human. Looking to play tricks on your overlord, are you? Hah! Think you that I do not see how must have hidden a mechanism within that shall do hurt to my arm?" "Please do not worry, Lord," Traore said. "See! I shall enter the stone chamber first, and then you can stretch your hand in after me. Should there be a trap to hurt you, will it not slay me first? Our tribe fears death and loves life almost as much as we love our gems — we'd never make such a sacrifice." True, that, the Volcano Lord thought. These puny little tribespeople always prized their lives, did they not? Why else would they have prepared a tribute of gems even before he had even arrived? And thus did Traore enter the stone chamber, golden whistle in hand, and the Volcano Lord extended his arm after him. And lo, there were indeed piles of gems inside. Traore poured jewels and ores into the Volcano Lord's hand, and the fist the Lord balled around the stones grew larger and larger... until it was larger even than the chamber gate! And it was at that moment—! Traore blew his golden whistle. The tribal warriors, lying in ambush by the stone chamber, prayed that their Wayob would unveil its power there and then. And the Wayob, borrowing four sewing pins — three short and one long — from the tribespeople, blew them toward the Volcano Lord. The four pins absorbed the power of both the tribespeople's flesh and blood and the Wayob, and so they grew as they flew, turning into four titanic phlogiston nails. Only then did the overlord realize that he had fallen into a trap, and cursed in his heart the cunning tribespeople. But his hand, so filled with gems, could no longer be opened. There was no retracting it from the stone chamber. One pin! Two pins! Three pins! The three smaller stone pillars pinned its jet-black arm to the Sulfurous Veins. But before the last and largest stone pillar could fall, the Volcano Lord, gritting its teeth, severed its own arm and fled. That black arm was left pinned to the ground like a shadow, which is why the long crystalline pillars of the Sulfurous Veins are known as Shadow Pins. As for the longest, largest Shadow Pin, it did not completely fall to the earth, for the Volcano Lord had already fled before then. However, so long as that Shadow Pin remains suspended over the Sulfurous Veins, never again shall the Volcano Lord dare draw near the Children of Echoes. And this is the story of said Lord and the Shadow Pins. As for Traore, who boldly used himself as bait, how did he escape the chamber, blocked as it now was by the Volcano Lord's arm? Why, he must have mastered some marvelous skill, of course. After all, there are many more legends concerning him that take place after this one...What kind of passerby will the young man, lost in a secluded bamboo grove, meet along his way? It was when dawn's first dew drizzled upon the lotus leaves, and frogs sang once more, that the young man began to wake. The morning sun cast shards of light through the bamboo wood, ever so slightly evaporating the previous night's dew still sticking on his linen clothes, while pearly glistening were the white mane-strands that yet lingered on his shoulder. As the sun shone upon his face, the young man stood up in his lethargy, half-opening his eyes. Only then did he discover that which had disturbed his slumber- a pair of eyes. sparkling like amber gold. "It's getting late, lazybones." The slender, golden-eyed woman leaned over slightly, her long platinum hair flowing over her shoulder. Her words bore annoyance, but her eyes hid a smile. The young man had come to this valley of hidden jade to cultivate his arts, only to unexpectedly encounter an adeptus on night as she, too, passed through these same woods. She wore a long white cotton robe, and a pearly raincoat and hat were about her. Her eyes were dazzling and gentle, yet indifferent, and her voice was elegant and tranquil, like jade that falls into a clear spring. She spoke of tales ancient and absorbing, so much so that he forgot the moon's rise and fall, the cycle of and orbit of the stars... Even the first croaks of frogs and cries of the cicadas at dawn slipped away from him. After that, she took him on a tour of secluded abodes where adepti dwelled, and there had him watch an unfinished game of chess; to the bottom of a clear river , exploring the court of deceased deities ; up steep cliffs that overlooked the desolated cities left behind by the mountain tribes... And still after, when silver butterflies glittered in the moonlight, they would explore the dreams of the fish that played beneath the springs, and they danced together like the ancestral mages who revered the serpent, accompanying the demons and gods of the mountain in falling into deep slumber only when the cicadas had fallen silent. Recalling all this, the young man gazed at her back and sighed. "What's wrong? You were fine just now, why are you zoning out of a sudden?" Sensing his companion's curiosity, the young man, who had thus far simply gazed at her in silence spoke of the misgiving he held in his heart. "Mortal are but transient guests between heaven and earth, and thus are inclined to momentary joy and sadness, binding ourselves to individual points in the past and forever seeking their echoes..." "But what would an adeptus think of such a lovely night?" "You do think highly of yourself. Alas, I may forget you in but a moment... We adepti really are heartless like that." Then, she gave him a sly smile, and her eyes squinted to slits. "But since you'd like to know, I'll tell you." Vol. 2 What kind of passerby will the young man, lost in a secluded bamboo grove, meet along his way? The adepti have a long lifespan, and thus they naturally perceive time differently from short-lived mortals. A mortal's eyes are fixed upon a narrow, limited future, but in her eyes, time unfurls like a vast painted screen. A mortal views time as an eternal river of blood. No matter how the crimson torrent rushes along its fixed paths, no matter how it branches and diverges, it surges inexorably toward a horizon so red it appears blackxe2x80x94 toward distant, silent death. But in her eyes, time is a barren wasteland with neither beginning nor end, blanketed in spider-silk threads that stretch to unknowable distances. Here, all things walk or run xe2x80x94 even the mighty mountains, so fixed in mortal sight, may dissipate like rolling clouds in hers. Even mercury, which mortals hold to be enduring, through her amber-gold eyes can be seen to wear, tear, and collapse xe2x80x94 to say nothing of such fleeting troubles or love. In the endless journey of life, mortals often miss their homeland, and thus wander amidst time's boundless flow, entertaining fantasies that a lost image could be recreated in the future. Though they are driven and pushed by the torrent of the passing years, and when forced to make devastating decision, they will often look back at the past, perplexed, as though light long-faded might yet return. But not so her. She sprinted forever alongside all movements, her flying hair ever white-gold as she shattered every wave and dispersed all sediment, caring only to run from this moment into the future. The mountain people once viewed her as time's daughter, like a white horse leaping from a pure spring, one whom no shackles could bind. Just as it was with her proud mother , so it was with her xe2x80x94 no wall or eggshell could bar her path. The shepherds of the plains once pursued her steps, freeing themselves from the fetters of the wilderness, embarking on a migratory search for the waterweeds, and thus did the golden-white foal blaze the trail for all herds in the land. The kingdom of the ocean depths once saw her as an emissary , and based on their imagination, they granted her scales and tail plumage, falling down in worship of the light brought by one who was both mother and daughter. In the days when mortals received the blessings of the heavens , great heroes and wandering champions would visit the clear springs for her blessing, fighting over the tenderness she left in her hurried wake. But when the moon palace collapsed, the chariot fell, and the three sisters were slain, these legends became lost alongside disaster's descent and the downfall of bygone peoples. The heavens rained down cruel order , and from that day, the stars stilled their orbits, and the earth ceased to turn.As for her, she had no choice but to be trapped within the shell of the starry sky , forced to tarry within this stagnant, foreign land , awaiting her mother's thousand threads , awaiting the erosion of hardy stone, awaiting the next encounter from beyond... "Now then, I've answered your question. And as for the story that follows, I told you much of it last night." He knew not when, but she had already wrapped herself in a white shirt. She turned her back to the scattered sunlight, and her amber-gold eyes glittered in the darkness. "I know it seems rude to mention this now... But I know you only as a transcendent adeptus, but not where you come from, or even your name. Might I have it?" Once again, just as she had once faced another child she knew not amidst the bamboo forest , she only laughed, saying nothing more. Sighing, the young man nodded to her, bidding her farewell. Many years later, the young man, now old and grey, recalled this moment by chance. By then, he had honed his swordplay to flow like water , founded his own sect , and became a teacher xe2x80x94 and still, he never could comprehend the final story she told him. And as for her, she sprints still along the threads of fate , concealing her trail beneath the forests and springs, far from the gaze of the gods , guarding the ancient stories that slip away from even her.

woven scroll passed down for generations in the Children of Echoes . It tells the legend of a young Sundjatta from 500 years ago. Oh, my brothers, my children, listen well, Listen well to my name — Djeli Mamoudou of the Children of Echoes . A singer am I of our tribe, a herald of epic tales. From Bilali, that first singer of sagas, does my line begin, And Keitan Kouyate and Bintu Kouyate are my forebears. Bilali it was who once followed a wandering sage to learn ancient verses, And the Kouyates wove the ancient texts into carpets and felt tents. My mind comprehends the dragon-lords and barbarian kings of benighted ages, My tongue can engage the most verbose Monetoo in verse, My stories illuminate many truths, my words purify more falsehoods, For stories cleanse untruths and become history, clear as a crystal mirror. Such mirrors gleam with rainbow light from ancient days, but darkness too is dazzling, Like a glimmer in the unfathomable eyes of the dead. History teaches the survivors, but stories are rooted in those who have passed... As surely as gems of the future must spring from the veins of the past. So come, hear me sing, hear me tell of this hero, Listen as I chant the soul-song of the children of the wild bull, the children of the rhinoceros. I shall tell you of Magan Sundjatta , his deeds, and his fate, I shall speak of Mali Djata's burdens and passion, I shall sing praise of Sogolon Djata's illustrious reputation, And of Nare Magan Djata's final battle against the great enemy... Oh, which hero has ever possessed so many titles? Neither the darkest magic nor the foulest wraith could hurt him! My brothers, my progeny, proud Children of Echoes, Listen, and I shall tell you of a hundred thousand barbarian kings, now forgotten, Harken as I tell you of their defeat at Sundjatta's hands, And how, once conquered, they fought by his side, Let me speak of how foes become friends, how savagery may yet birth goodwill... Let me tell of how the pitch-dark armies came forth like a mountain, And how they dissolved before Sundjatta's might, For this is a tale of great deeds once unrecorded, sacrifices misunderstood... Vol. 2 A woven scroll passed down for generations in the Children of Echoes. It tells the legend of a young Sundjatta from 500 years ago. It is as they say, that many who are wise are not of noble birth. So too had Sundjatta's lineage never been tainted by ancient royalty. The old tales have faded like salt rivers in a darkened mine, Leaving but shimmering crystals of truth for poets to reveal. So it is with Sundjatta, and many are the account of his birth. Close friends may desire to embellish, and amongst enemies one shall find a lack of praise. What were the names of his parents? Which tribe were they from? Ask the pale light of three moons, and still you shall have no answer. Story and song say Sundjatta was born blessed by the stars of dawn. No beauty his mother, no strongman his father, But the celestial watcher-stars care not for mortal appearance, For to weave the fate of heaven and earth alone is duty eternal, a task divine. Mbande was chief of our tribe when Sundjatta was young, Black-Jade Mbande, who was the mother of mines and gems, T'was she who chose him to be our tribe's hero. And thus did his story begin, the hero great, the miner mighty. When young Sundjatta began his career in the mines, The mountain-carving hammers were larger than his whole body. Yet he wielded them as though he were the wind itself, So much so that heroes cried out, "The mine! It's about to collapse!" "Haha! Brothers, sisters, do not be afraid!" "'Tis merely my hammer summoning up a gale. See? A whoop, and a whoosh!" Thus did he swing on, chiseling into the great mountain, sparks flying from the hammer's handle, And they all looked on in joy and fear, as the champion's laurels he claimed! When Lady Mbande returned to the Lord of the Night 's embrace, Sundjatta was already a young man, robust beyond his years. On the night when a chief was to be elected, he left the tribe alone, Tribal champion though he was, Sundjatta aspired not to power, But instead sought to find a proud testament to his existence as one of us, Resolute was he, striking out on an adventure toward lands distant and foreign, Yet his passion was misunderstood by his tribespeople, who regarded him as a runaway, a traitor... Vol. 3 A woven scroll passed down for generations in the Children of Echoes. It tells the legend of a young Sundjatta from 500 years ago. Sundjatta, who had lost his good name by voluntarily embarking on an adventurous journey, Headed to the distant lava lake, letting the scorching waves burn his body. This burning lake has now cooled, and dragons play havoc there no more, But in those days, it was the abode ruled by the evil dragon Lukwata, One of the few survivors of the ancient dragon race, Who, with malice in its heart, sought ever to restore ancient draconic tyranny. The ancient war, which had rocked both heaven and earth, had destroyed its tribe, But it hid in a dark, rocky cave, thus evading utter devastation. Without servants to wait upon it, Lukwata had grown decrepit, Eyes scorched blind by sulfur's breath, mind becoming dull and frenzied. Inextricably trapped in a delirious dream of battle against heavenly envoys , clinging to life, Unaware of the human epoch that had come upon Natlan . So when a tiny slave came to its hideout and issued a challenge, The ancient dragon arose in fury, coughing and retching, hurling curses unceasingly, Along with which spewed flames and sulfur from its maw, "You insolent wretch! You dare disturb my royal slumber!?" Sundjatta saw that the vile dragon of legend had long become doddering and deranged, That it would claim a Sovereign 's title while forgetting its race. So he burst into laughter, hoisting his massive hammer, and mocked the enfeebled drake: "I am merely a nameless miner, not some contemptible knave." "Just as you are no king — merely a tottering lizard!" Rage surged in Lukwata's throat upon hearing these words, and with more wild retching, It spat forth filthy, scorching lava, billowing forth plumes of pitch-black smoke, At which Sundjatta did not even frown, instead swinging his heavy hammer down on the old drake. Old and infirm was Lukwata, yet when enraged it remained terrifyingly formidable, And as the great heat of the magma scorched Sundjatta's hair and eyebrows, The dragon's fierce venom again seeped into flesh and viscera, the unbearable agony burning deep, And its massive yellowed fangs left festering wounds, while sharpened claws tore open old scars. Yet on and on Sundjatta swung, enduring tremendous pain, Until the dragon's craggy head split open, until the hammer-storm blew the black smog away. And when the elder dragon's soul had been scattered to the winds, and the magma lake had cooled by half, Sundjatta lay down, contented xe2x80x94 truly now did he deserve a hero's name!

to be a tapestry personally woven by Master Sanhaj Kompore , its contents are both short and strange. Generally believed to be a work of pure fiction. This tapestry is said to have been woven by Sanhaj Kompore, a hero of the Masters of the Night-Wind . Its contents are brief and bizarre, often dismissed as a joke by the elder shamans xe2x80x94 and just like the countless jests this cunning hero told throughout his life, this one's colors carry a hint of moonlit darkness. Some say it was due to the threads he used, while others claim he ground obsidian and black-colored mussel shells into powder to achieve this touch of divinity. Long, long ago, there was a cunning rogue amongst the Masters of the Night-Wind named Kompore. He was skilled in deception and theft, gaining advantage by both cunning and force, and thus was notorious within the tribe, but he had an honest brother named Sanhaj. In that ancient time, the Lord of the Crossroads still walked among mortals, bestowing the grace of sleep or death upon the six tribes' people, guiding them along the path to the netherworld, and merging their souls into the great black river. He was master of the Night Realm , both "Papa Witch Doctor" and "Mama Dream-Realm." Legends speak of him building a small brewery at the end of the great black river, where he could reveal the fate of any person in dreams by drinking the mushroom wine brewed there. "If I had this ability, would I not become like the prophets of our tribe, able to predict fate and uncover the truth that lies beneath this world?" The rogue's eyes roved about, and he thought to himself again, "And if that were the case, how much profit could secret knowledge and forbidden dreams bring me? What could I use such treasures to negotiate for?" The cunning Kompore rubbed his palms, and thus began his crafty scheme. Vol. 2 Said to be a tapestry personally woven by Master Sanhaj Kompore, its contents are both short and strange. Generally believed to be a work of pure fiction. To trick the Lord of the Crossroads out of this miraculous mushroom wine, Kompore brought his honest brother Sanhaj and said to him: "My brother, your kindness is renowned throughout our tribe. I know you have a pure heart, always speaking honest words and doing earnest deeds. So, I ask you to keep our upcoming plans in strict confidence, with true heart and kinship." Sanhaj, unaware of his brother's sinister plan, nodded and agreed. "Alright then. I'll tell you my plan, but you must cooperate with me and not reveal it to anyone." So, Kompore began to slowly unveil his wicked scheme: "I want you to visit the Lord of the Crossroads. Claim that I am on the brink of death, and say that you hope to obtain Papa Witch Doctor's medicine to cure my illness. While that is happening, I will infiltrate his hut and steal his mushroom wine. With it, we can grant more wisdom to our tribe and eliminate more of its troubles." "Think it over, would you, dear brother? Just imagine how much our tribe would gain from obtaining that wine xe2x80x94 not to mention how much we'd both benefit!" The younger brother had wanted to refuse, but having rashly agreed to his brother's first request, he could only consent to Kompore's sinister plot. Of course, this is merely Kompore's own account. Why did he cast himself as a villain who betrayed his brother, and is this story truly or falsely told? Yet, since he has become a tribal hero, very few dare to investigate further. Vol. 3 Said to be a tapestry personally woven by Master Sanhaj Kompore, its contents are both short and strange. Generally believed to be a work of pure fiction. Although Sanhaj had agreed to his brother's treacherous plot, his honest heart was filled with anguish and doubt over deceiving the Lord of the Crossroads. Thus, in his troubled dreams, Sanhaj revealed his brother's scheme. Mama Dream-Realm stretched out her hands as black as night, embracing the honest Sanhaj and kissing his brow. In the dark, silent dream, she had already forgiven Sanhaj's crimes. Indeed, as a reward for his honesty, she poured the mysterious mushroom wine into an obsidian cup and handed it to him. However, at this moment, Kompore burst into his brother's tent and threw a rough hemp rope around his sleeping brother's neck xe2x80x94 long had he known that his brother would reveal his plan to the Lord of the Crossroads. And so, before the master of dreams could even issue a warning, Sanhaj met his end at the hands of his own brother. The obsidian cup filled with mushroom wine slipped from his grasp, staining his chest and the bloodsoaked hemp rope tightly wound around his neck. This grave crime enraged the Lord of the Crossroads, who grieved Sanhaj's death. He immediately laid a curse upon the cunning Kompore: his unhappy brother Sanhaj would be resurrected within him, and would prophesize the fullness of his fate. From that moment on, all those he had deceived and murdered would be forever etched in his memory; and every lie he had ever told, his brother would repeat a thousand times over in his ear. Thus did Kompore gain the boon from drinking the mushroom wine, yet stain himself with an indelible sin and curse. So it was that Kompore gained a new name, "Sanhaj Kompore." Only much, much later, when Tenoch mustered heroes for a final stand against the wild, pitch-black torrent , did he finally find a way to redeem himself... but that is another story. Haha, likewise, since many tribespeople have witnessed Sanhaj Kompore's scheming smile in the pitch-dark night, even after that decisive day of battle... that story must surely be yet another of Sanhaj Kompore's jokes or riddles.

2 Vol. 3 Vol. 1 A book of hymns passed down for generations among the Frostmoon Scions , compiled by the priestess Ehrnrooth . Most of its contents, and the rites they serve, have long since fallen into disuse. O lips, now voice a solemn hymn for me, to speak the North's old warnings, low and high. I've left my land, my native shores, departed home and wandered far... Through realms unknown, where none know my name, across a barren land long lost to fame... Bleak tundras find rest in deep water's wake, only snow dances upon a thousand lakes. Yet still the moonlight bathes the path I trace, and winds still brush the sorrow from my face. Let me sing of how the moon first kissed the land, let me chant the verse that drives back evil bands. I praise the rivers raging strong, and praise the peaks that range ever on. I praise the bronze-bound ship of Seutervoinen, and the golden arrows of Ianikuinen unbroken. I curse the poisonous plot of Pakkaisukko, and decry Pohjola's calamity forever more. My prayer, a sacred word from Heaven above, sang to my forebears by envoys beloved. But fate is in the end like a fleeting dream, and death, like waters clear, drowns every eye. So long as moonlight hangs in its prison on high, I cannot return to home beloved, even if it be nigh. Where golden light soft through verdant crown shines, where dawnstars in silver array the pines. O heirs of Hyperborea , mark this song, etch it in your minds fast and strong. Seek not to tread the sly fox-paths slight, nor yearn for the great bear's haughty might. But so long as hymn and Runo ring, the far North shall endure and eternal spring. Prayer Song I: Pitkamoonen , Lord of the Seven Calamities (The summer solstice. Burn the season's first sheaf of wheat. To this offering add: a hen, an ox, snake gall equal in weight to the grain, as well as seven cups of the blood of xe2x96x88xe2x96x88xe2x96x88xe2x96x88's xe2x96x88xe2x96x88xe2x96x88xe2x96x88xe2x96x88. The Archpriestess chants the Runo seven times, then performs divination using animal entrails to appease the gods.) O supreme Lord of the Sky, merciless and indomitable, Father of All and Mother of the Gods, We offer these sacrifices to appease your jealousy, lest your wrath blaze against the earth. O capricious winged one, fierce king who lays waste to nations, god of the unyielding heart, O god of gender unknowable, we plead that you turn from the mortal realm and the children of the farthest north. You have shattered the order of the old laws and offered shelter to mortals, and yet xe2x96x88xe2x96x88xe2x96x88 them. You have shaken the ancient dwellings of the eternals, xe2x96x88xe2x96x88xe2x96x88ed their wings, and laid waste to their xe2x96x88xe2x96x88xe2x96x88. You are the god of retribution, the vengeful deity. Your will is absolute beneath the moon, never to be disobeyed. In heaven and on earth your blade xe2x96x88xe2x96x88, drinking dry the xe2x96x88xe2x96x88 of the wicked and the innocent. O xe2x96x88xe2x96x88 and xe2x96x88xe2x96x88 king: before you, the gods are as mere mortals, and mortals, naught more than insects. No one dares to speak your name, for you shall xe2x96x88xe2x96x88 all who know it. But O pure and wrathful god, we humbly ask you to accept this offering. May the Frost Moon shield us from the calamities you bring, and spare us the fate of eternal suffering. (Note From Priestess Ehrnrooth: This ritual was abolished five centuries ago by decree of Aila, the first Moonchanter. It is notable that the prayer's obscured portions were not deliberately redacted, if the relevant records are to be believed. Instead, the Archpriestess was to chant in an indistinct manner to avoid provoking the god of the Seven Calamities.) Prayer Song II: Maadteraahka , Mother of Life (Upon the birth of a child, a pinch of sea salt is offered to the sacred stone. Clergy of Assistant Priestess rank or higher shall chant the Runo four times before the newborn is bathed in warm water infused with Winter Icelea.) Hear me, O noble Maadteraahka, mother of gods and mortals, From Hyperborea to Sal Vindagnyr , your compassion is revered by all. You watch over young women, easing their suffering and granting safe passage through childbirth. You rejoice in fecundity, give life to the sublunary sphere, nurture all that grows in nature. You, mother of the waters, who birthed a heart for the roaring primordial ocean , All the birds, beasts, and fish in this world are yours, for you are the one who brought them into being. By your divine will, you shape mortal flesh as a potter shapes clay, Therefore, I pray you bless this newborn child with health, courage, and wisdom. (Note From Priestess Ehrnrooth: This ritual was abolished five centuries ago by decree of Aila, the first Moonchanter. In its place, one who is ranked Assistant Priestess or higher is to recite "May the new moon illuminate your path" instead. This is meant to invoke protection for the child from the taint of the sublunary sphere.) Prayer Song III: Tuonetar , Mother of the Underworld (During the autumn harvest, animal sacrifices are offered in accordance with the social status of those who died that year. The prepared animals are placed in intricately carved wooden or bronze vessels, shaped like boats, to be burned. Before the burning, a clergy member of Assistant Priestess rank or higher removes the eyes of each animal and presents them separately to the mistress of the underworld. With eyes veiled by a dark cloth, the Archpriestess then chants the Runo four times and performs divination using animal entrails to please the deity.) O Mistress of the dead, slow to be moved and without expression, O shadowy lady of the underworld xe2x80x94 somber, taciturn, fearsome Tuonetar! You abhor the arrogant and the disrespectful, and from your grasp, there is no escape. Your feet have trod both the humble hut and the gilded throne. The people fear you, for you see all, hear all, and judge all. We revere you for your boundless grace and all-embracing nature. The fate of all living beings rests solely in your hands, and you remain unmoved no matter how fervent the plea. Yet noble and majestic goddess, we know that gentleness and mercy are your first nature. Just as you granted our ancestors liberation from suffering and extended it not, O mistress of death, you who know the fates of all under the moon, accept our humble offering. The descendants of the far north beseech you, now that the golden bloodline has returned to your bosom, That you lead us across the nether's dark stream, and let us sleep eternal in a dreamless dream. (Note From Priestess Ehrnrooth: This ritual was abolished by decree of Aila, the first Moonchanter, five centuries ago. Now, when a aherent of the Frost Moon dies, regardless of social status, an Assistant Priestess, or someone of higher rank, is to recite instead "May the new moon lead you to the shore of peace." A simple and solemn funeral is then conducted.) Prayer Song IV: Laimelea , Mother of Time (On the Winter Solstice, a cloth bearing the year's significant events is burned, and its ashes are gathered in a silver cup filled with pure water. The Archpriestess chants the Runo four times, and when the wind begins to stir, they anoint the Verdant Crest with the blessed mixture to honor the divinity.) O pure and eternal Mother of Time, sovereign who was never born and who shall never die, You create all and destroy all. You remember all and allow them to be forgotten. You who in the moment of your birth, also gave birth to yourself, O supreme mother, You are the one stillness within the endless flow, the one outsider in the sacred courtyard of the gods. May you protect the four imprisoned moons. You are the one outsider in the sacred courtyard of the gods, the one stillness within the endless flow. O supreme mother, who in the moment of your own birth also gave birth to yourself, You remember all and allow them to be forgotten. You create all and destroy all. O sovereign who shall never die and who was never born, pure and eternal Mother of Time! (Note from the Priestess Ehrnrooth: The meaning of this prayer remains obscure, and the ritual described herein contradicts established historical records. The Verdant Crest, a Divine Tree that appeared at the birth of the Moon Maiden five centuries ago, should not feature in any account of rituals predating that event. As no other known texts reference these rites, this is presumed to be a scribal error. Nevertheless, this passage has been preserved unaltered for the sake of textual fidelity.) Prayer Song V: Missing Vol. 2 A book of hymns passed down for generations among the Frostmoon Scions, compiled by the priestess Ehrnrooth. Most of its contents, and the rites they serve, have long since fallen into disuse. Prayer Song VI: Takoja Ianikuinen , the Primeval Blacksmith O great father of genesis, forger of the earth's bones and the tripled moons , Let your wrath right that askew throne so that the beauty may submit. On the first day, you forged a golden bow with lunar gleam, a weapon meant to strike down your foes. Yet while you hunted, your bow was stolen, and now your enemy brandishes it as their own. On the second day, you forged a great chariot, its moonlit glimmer meant to guard your home. Yet while you hunted, your wain was purloined, and your enemy claimed it as their own. On the third day, you forged a shuttle of moonlight, your heart set on the daughter of the stars. Yet in your recklessness, you wandered into a fog-drenched swamp, and the forge of light was quenched. You are the king spoken of yet unspeakable, O bloodthirsty, murderous blacksmith, You are the master of misfortune, the lord of all evil, obsessed with the unjust deaths of the innocent and the ruinous fires of war. O terrible and mighty Eternal Workman, lord of two natures, So strong, hale, and heroic as the gods themselves. Even the stars look upon you in awe. O indestructible Lord, please quiet this earth-shaking wrath. Lift the torment that occupies my heart and cast out this pitch-black disaster . (Note from the Priestess Ehrnrooth: This is an ancient form of the prayer once used to quell the fury of nature. Though records whisper of a lost variant, its final four lines meant to summon, rather than quell, natural disasters, it vanished from memory long before the birth of the Moon Maiden, for reasons unknown. The Moonchanter Aila, first to hold the title, later revised and simplified this prayer. Her version, presented below, is now recognized as the standard for all recitations: O pale white Frost Moon, in the name of the descendants of the far north, I beseech you to appease this earth-shaking wrath. May your gentle light soothe the lingering pain that occupies our hearts, and cast out that pitch-black disaster!) ... Prayer Song XI: The Goddess of the Dawnstar and Apostle of the Far North - Koitar and Seutervoinen I call upon Koitar, wife of Seutervoinen and first, fairest daughter of the creator god, O generous maiden and bright morning star, your deeds are forever praised in music by the descendants of the far north. The cold wind of night cannot extinguish the silver flame within our chests, nor can its perilous darkness corrupt our hearts. One day, we shall return home, through the wild grasses of the lonely graveyards to the majestic golden city. I call upon you, Koitar truly-blessed, to cast your favor upon our conquests, even as you once subdued all nations with your might. I call upon you to shake the earth, to make the cities tremble, and to let the enemies of the far north vanish like dew beneath the Frost Moon. (Note from the Priestess Ehrnrooth: This prayer is an older form, preserved from a time long past. It was later significantly revised by Aila, the first Moonchanter. The following text is now recognized as the standard for all recitations: The icy winds cannot extinguish the silver flame within our chests, nor shall the evil nights corrupt our hearts. O pale white Frost Moon, protect the descendants of the far north, and let the pitch-black disasters of the cold night melt away like the morning dew.) ... Prayer Song XVI: Saarelainen , The Stranger of Winter's Day O, let not the death-pangs you suffered pass into me, lover of frost and winter. You cheerful, fair, kind-hearted lad, noble-born and nobly raised, a gentle and valiant son. Upon the starry steed, you rode across the forsaken isle of Hiisi and the dark, mist-shrouded lands of Pohjola, There to court the daughter of Pakkaisukko, that peerless beauty, at her home. Then old Pakkaisukko, servant of our forebears, answered thus: He will grant the young lady's hand in marriage if you should open for him the gates of Pohjola. Cheerful, fair, kind-hearted one, you knew well that wicked scheme, yet you went forth freely. For were you not to go, old Pakkaisukko would have his gullible daughter suffer the punishment instead. In dark and foggy Pohjola, the Lord of the Seven Calamities carved you into seven pieces . And that young and pure girl, the daughter of Pakkaisukko, shall never again be wed. O lost hero, I call upon you by your unspeakable name, you the healer of the world's sorrows and misfortunes, And may your grace still the wild winds of the frigid night and bring warmth to the young birds huddled on the frozen earth. (Note from the Priestess Ehrnrooth: This is an old version of a prayer for wound healing and the curing of disease that was later revised and simplified by the first Moonchanter, Aila. The following text is now recognized as the standard for all recitations: O lost child, in the name of the descendants of the far north, I pray for the blessing of light. May the Frost Moon's grace still the wild winds of the cold night and bring warmth to the young birds huddled on the frozen earth.) Vol. 3 A book of hymns passed down for generations among the Frostmoon Scions, compiled by the priestess Ehrnrooth. Most of its contents, and the rites they serve, have long since fallen into disuse. Prayer Song XXI: Huurrekuutar , Goddess of the Frost Moon O Huurrekuutar, mother of holy light, pray hear my pleas and cast your gaze from on high. May your silent tears pierce the cold night, light a silver torch that never fades, and grant the people of the far north a guiding light. O Huurrekuutar, mother of the silver shuttle, hearken to my prayer and clothe the heavens in gentle veils. May your spun silver thread lead lost souls from the underworld's filth, that they may not lose their way in the cold night. O Huurrekuutar, wherever you lead, we shall follow, and your will shall be our law. Better that the cold night of death blind our sight, than that we sing in shame beneath a false light. (Note from the Priestess Ehrnrooth: This is an older, unedited version of the prayer. It was originally brief, as the only matters too sacred to be spoken of at length were the chief god who protected our ancestors, and the origin, past, and future of the moons. The first Moonchanter, Aila, later revised and simplified the prayer's content. The following text is now recognized as the standard for all recitations: O pale white Frost Moon, in the name of the descendants of the far north, I beseech you to cast down your gaze from the celestial dome above. May your gentle tears pierce the frigid night, and grant us, the forsaken and forgotten, your guiding light.) Prayer Song XXII: Kuutar , the Moon Maiden O pure and flawless new moon, in the name of the messenger of the Frost Moon, I beg for your grace and mercy. Cleanse us of our sins, I pray, and wipe away the endless pains and tears of those forever barred from Elysium .May the gentle breeze of Barbatos carry words of enlightenment and deliver them into the gaze of my readers. And may the wind of freedom forever prevail in Mondstadt . The story of the Gunnhildr Clan begins in legend, three thousand years ago during the war between the Lord of the Tower, Decarabian , and the King of the North Wind, Andrius . It was a time when Mondstadt was a frozen wasteland, and Gunnhildr was about to become the strongest leader her nomadic clan had ever seen. Gunnhildr's father, the then-leader of the clan, had once served under Decarabian. He served until he found the despotic rule of the aloof and selfish king to be more than he could bear, whereupon he had led his clan outside of the city where ferocious winds howled without mercy. But life in the wasteland beyond the city gates was harsh and unforgiving. Though they had escaped the wrath of a tyrant, they were now faced with the wrath of relentless and all-engulfing blizzards. Just when all hope seemed to be lost for the wandering clan, a spirit from the midst of the myriad winds heard Gunnhildr's prayers. The sincere plea of a clan chief's young daughter joined with a people's cry of help, a cry that the blizzard had all but drowned out, and became a faith. The faith gathered in front of the wind spirit like water flowing into a spring and became the source from which the wind spirit drew its power. The wind spirit used this power to make a small shelter for the clan, and bestowed upon the clan chief's daughter the power to protect. After her father's death, Gunnhildr took his place as the clan's leader. She also became its first priestess. From that day forth, she protected her clan faithfully. When the Anemo Archon Barbatos challenged the aloof and selfish king Decarabian's rule, Gunnhildr led her people to make a stand against the Archon's fury. &#91; Note 1 &#93; But when Barbatos finally fought through the ferocious winds and freed the tyrant's subjects, she was also the one who decorated the victorious Anemo Archon with laurels. &#91; Note 2 &#93; In later times, after Barbatos had departed, a class of aristocrats emerged across the land. These rulers, who were possessed of divine power, would become corrupted and turn to tyranny themselves a thousand years later, but none had the ability to predict the distant future. Not even Barbatos himself. Gunnhildr's descendants were themselves a prominent clan within the Aristocracy. But unlike the evil and scheming Lawrence Clan , the Gunnhildrs upheld their legacy of protecting Mondstadt that was always enshrined in their motto, "for Mondstadt, as always," doing everything within their power to protect its people. During the later struggle to overthrow the Aristocracy, they took the side of the people of Mondstadt. For this reason, they were spared the sentence of exile that was imposed on the rest of the Aristocracy. Today, the Gunnhildr Clan is a source of many brave knights and outstanding clergy members that serve in the Knights of Favonius . If history can teach us anything at all about the future, perhaps it is that the Gunnhildr Clan will continue honoring the legacy of its ancestors and its duty to the Anemo Archon: to protect Mondstadt, the land and all who inhabit it, forever.Many years later, when Gothson's ankle would become trapped in the same unlucky beast trap he had laid, he must have recalled the afternoon when his father had taken him into the city to take part in Ludi Harpastum . Gothson's whole life was, without a doubt, unfortunate. But he could never quite recall when his misfortunes had begun. He spent his childhood in Springvale , under the protection of the spring fairy . Indeed, all the hunters lived peaceful and carefree lives. When Gothson was seven summers old, his father took him to Mondstadt to watch the circus at Ludi Harpastum. This was the first time Gothson had entered the city in his life. He was held spellbound by the aromas of sweets and roasted meats, the brilliant lights and colored paper, the clowns who trained wild boars, and the magicians and their tricks. In his dazzling childhood memories, Gothson dimly saw his father walking into the reveling crowds, passing through an archway marked with the words "Pile 'Em Up Contest," and slowly moving further away from him. But his attention was drawn to the shining fairy of the spring. Perhaps he came to understand in his later years that the spirit at the festival was no more than an actor paid 20 Mora a day, but in his young mind, that sight was always one full of fantastical imagination. Gothson was lulled to sleep by the spring fairy's stories, and far abroad did he wander and adventure in his boundless dreams. In an adventurer's dream, he saw rainbow jam pour forth from the mouth of an ancient relief. Gothson was about to step up and partake of it, when his dream was shattered by the sound of a fracas. "Run!" His father's panicked, pudgy face, smeared all over with fruit juice and meat sauce, dominated his vision. Over his shoulder, Gothson could see a towering stack of roasted meat under a glowing red light, tottering and trembling as it bent his way amid the horrified cries of the crowd. In his flight, Gothson's father knocked a fat lady over, and threw his own hip. At once he fell, his full weight collapsing upon his son. Then, the leaning tower of roasted meat collapsed to echoing screams... The Knights of Favonius took three days to finally clear up the roast meat, vegetables, food items, and other odds and ends that had been scattered all around the square—not to mention carry off those who had gotten a little too out of their gourds. From then on, they were forced to declare, all future Ludi Harpastums would have to be held outside the city. So it was, then, that Gothson's house was short two hunters and had two sick people added to their number, all in one night. What did they get for it? A gold-plated champion's medal—two days late, to boot.When the first wisp of wind brushed across the land Birds that yearned for the sky had wings But no way to fly They asked the Anemo God : "How can we reach the heavens?" To which the Anemo God replied: "You have yet to find that which is most important" As the God spoke, the wind thrust the seeds of a dandelion High into the sky The birds thrust out their wings But the breeze was all too mild Leaving them to stumble across the earth So they went to the gorge Where the wind showed off its wild and incomparable strength They threw themselves off the cliff And flapped their wings amongst the howling winds Until they were able to fly freely in the sky To the Anemo God they went, to gleefully say: "We understand now! All we needed was a stronger wind to fly" In reply the Anemo God said: "What you lacked was not wind, but courage" "It is courage that has allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world" Gallery -Cutscene Animation- Knights Gliding Maunal Book - Genshin Impact Other Languages Language Official Name Literal Meaning English Wind, Courage, and Wings — Chinese (Simplified) xe9xa3x8exe3x80x81xe5x8bx87xe6xb0x94xe5x92x8cxe7xbfx85xe8x86x80 Fxc4x93ng, Yxc7x92ngqxc3xac hxc3xa9 Chxc3xacbxc7x8eng Wind, Courage, and Wings Chinese (Traditional) xe9xa2xa8xe3x80x81xe5x8bx87xe6xb0xa3xe5x92x8cxe7xbfx85xe8x86x80 Fxc4x93ng, Yxc7x92ngqxc3xac hxc3xa0n Chxc3xacbxc7x8eng Japanese xe9xa2xa8xe3x80x81xe5x8bx87xe6xb0x97xe3x81xa8xe7xbfxbc Kaze, Yuuki to Tsubasa Wind, Courage, and Wings Korean xebxb0x94xebx9ex8c , xecx9axa9xeaxb8xb0xecx99x80 xebx82xa0xeaxb0x9c Baram, Yonggiwa Nalgae Wind, Courage, and Wings Spanish Viento, coraje y alas Wind, Courage, and Wings French Vents, courage&#160;&amp; ailes Winds, Courage &amp; Wings Russian xd0x92xd0xb5xd1x82xd0xb5xd1x80 , xd1x85xd1x80xd0xb0xd0xb1xd1x80xd0xbexd1x81xd1x82xd1x8c xd0xb8 xd0xbaxd1x80xd1x8bxd0xbbxd1x8cxd1x8f Veter, khrabrost' i kryl'ya Wind, Courage, and Wings Thai xe0xb8xaaxe0xb8xb2xe0xb8xa2xe0xb8xa5xe0xb8xa1 , xe0xb8x84xe0xb8xa7xe0xb8xb2xe0xb8xa1xe0xb8x81xe0xb8xa5xe0xb9x89xe0xb8xb2xe0xb9x81xe0xb8xa5xe0xb8xb0xe0xb8x9bxe0xb8xb5xe0xb8x81 Vietnamese Gixc3xb3, xc4x90xc3xb4i Cxc3xa1nh Vxc3xa0 &#8203; Dxc5xa9ng Khxc3xad xe5x8bx87xe6xb0xa3 &#8203; Wind, Wings, and Courage German Von Wind, Tapferkeit und Fl xc3xbc geln Of Wind, Courage and Wings Indonesian Angin, Keberanian, dan Sayap Wind, Courage, and Wings Portuguese Vento, Coragem e Asas Wind, Courage, and Wings Turkish R xc3xbc zgar, Cesaret ve Kanatlar Wind, Courage, and Wings Italian Il vento, il coraggio e le ali Change History Released in Version 1.0 Create New History Navigation &#160; Books &#160; Mondstadt Inventory "Of Mountains and Seas" 1000 Years of Loneliness Along with Divinity: Prologue Ancient Investigation Journal: Part I Ancient Investigation Journal: Part II Ancient Investigation Journal: Part III Biography of Gunnhildr Gliding Instruction Manual History of Kings and Clans: Prologue Knights of Favonius Handbook - 5th Edition Lost Adventure Notebook Ragged Notebook (Time and Wind) Thick Notebook Wind, Courage, and Wings (Book) Handy Handbook of Hilichurlian Archive Draft Hilichurl Ballads The Mondstadt Tower A Drunkard's Tale Ballads of the Squire Breeze Amidst the Forest Heart of Clear Springs Hilichurl Ballad Selection Hilichurl Cultural Customs The Legend of Vennessa Hex &amp; Hound The Boar Princess The Fox in the Dandelion Sea &#160; Liyue Inventory Humor From Tianheng Linling's Anthology of Selected Poetry Meadow of Gems Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I Verses of Equilibrium Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti Mountainous Miscellany Ragged Notebook (Bygones Times Like Dust Passing) Records of a Changing Village Archive Customs of Liyue Moonlit Bamboo Forest Mt.

handbook is a guide on the core principles of the Knights of Favonius . Knights should carefully read the contents of this handbook and strictly hold themselves to the standards detailed within their life and work, serving the people of Mondstadt as a model Knight of Favonius. As members of the Knights of Favonius, it is incumbent upon us to be the very embodiment of the three virtues of knighthood: modesty, honesty, and self-control. These are the three pillars of Mondstadt's freedom - remember, freedom cannot exist without the support of duty. The direct embodiment of these values comes, of course, in one's everyday speech and actions. Hence, this handbook outlines behavioral standards and language usage prescriptions that are intended to cover all potential scenarios that you may encounter in the course of duty. Section One A knight must exercise vigilance at all times and must never treat any potential threat to Mondstadt lightly. When it comes to your attention that a citizen of Mondstadt in need, you must come to their aid promptly and willingly, for it is the fundamental duty of the Knights of Favonius to be of service to the people of Mondstadt. Section Two When greeting a traveling merchant from a distant land, pay attention to express proper respect and courtesy. Do not exhibit suspicion or hostility towards them, no matter how suspicious they may seem. Approved Language: "Welcome to Mondstadt, strange yet respectable traveler(s)/wayfarer(s)/guest(s)!* Please state your identity and intended destination. The Knights of Favonius are here to ensure your safety." *Select the appropriate term of address accordingly. Prohibited Language: "Hey, you! Stop right there! State your identity, you rascal(s)/hooligan(s)/ruffian(s)/outlander(s)/trespasser(s)!" "Welcome to the City of Wind and Song, otherworldly traveler(s)/vagrant animal(s)/burgeoning storm(s)." Note: Refrain from using vulgar or coarse language. It is especially important never to address the guest using pejorative nomenclature, for this is certain to make them feel most unwelcome indeed. Section Three Never meet members of the public with an attitude of nonchalance or apathy. A responsible knight must always be ready to offer up both sword and sweat for the people's sake. Accordingly, during periods of rest, recreation, or relative inactivity, you must maintain a knightly disposition and be ready to fully re-engage in work matters at a moment's notice. Approved Language: (Musing to oneself while on a break) "I shall check for any previously undiscovered safety issues in Mondstadt - for I, as a knight, have a duty to safeguard Mondstadt at all times." (Conversing with city folk at the tavern) "As a knight, I am expected to gain an understanding of people's day-to-day needs and concerns, this knowledge is also indispensable to me in the performance of my duties." Note: Even when there is no work to be done whatsoever, it is not permissible to take a gratuitous amount of down time at your own discretion. Prohibited Language: (On active guard duty) "Imagine having a lifetime's supply of cider..." (While taking a break) " Noeeeelle ... Have you got a minute..." Note: The Acting Grand Master has instructed Noelle to immediately report any work-shy knights who attempt to delegate their existing duties to her. It should go without saying that this behavior is entirely unacceptable. Penalties for violations will take the form of reduced vacation allowance and/or salary deductions. The next time that you consider shirking your duties, you are strongly advised to consider whether the consequences are worth it. Section Four While the Knights of Favonius respect the important place of wine in Mondstadt's cultural heritage, it is nevertheless expected that knights will exercise due self-control with regard to their alcohol intake. It is not permitted to be drunk while on duty, and it is strictly forbidden to encourage or facilitate the consumption of alcohol by minors. Note: Knights of Favonius who are not of legal drinking age are forbidden from consuming alcohol. Accordingly, minors must always be accompanied by an adult coworker when entering taverns and other premises where alcohol is served. Section Five (New) Owing to a recent increase in Fatui activity in the city, knights are reminded that it is forbidden to disclose details of any matters concerning Knights of Favonius operations and strategic deployment to any persons from outside the organization while not on active duty. Section Six In the event of a major Mondstadt-wide emergency, Knights of Favonius are expected to lead by example and act to safeguard human lives and property. In times of crisis, when people come to you with questions, it is important to answer them clearly and calmly, and to remind them to prioritize their personal safety at all times. Approved Language: "Please, do not worry. The Knights of Favonius will do their utmost to protect Mondstadt!" "When danger is imminent, please do not panic. Cover your head with both hands, and crouch down to protect your vital parts. Then, follow the instructions given to you by the Knights of Favonius crew, who will lead you to safety in a swift and orderly fashion." (New) "Please rest assured that even though Grand Master Varka is not currently in Mondstadt, the Knights of Favonius are quite well equipped to deal with this crisis in a swift and elegant manner."* *Only applicable during the Grand Master's absence. Prohibited Language: "Uh-oh, we've never had to deal with a situation like this before..." "Even the knights are powerless in the face of a crisis of this magnitude..." Note: Even in extreme cases where the crisis is indeed of a kind that has not been seen before, it is imperative that you do not appear overwhelmed in front of members of the public, and that you do not do or say anything to call into question the capabilities of the Knights of Favonius. Section Seven When greeting travelers from afar, please act hospitably by informing them of the locations of essential businesses and services, recommending popular tourist destinations, and giving any further assistance that they may request or require. Approved Language: "If it's your first time here, I recommend visiting Mondstadt's Cathedral ." "If you're tired, go have some of Mondstadt's famous wine at a tavern called ' Angel's Share .'" Section Eight Remember to espouse the virtues of modesty and honesty also in your interactions with coworkers and companions. That is to say, be self-effacing in conversation with comrades, and be open and truthful with them. Nurturing and maintaining a sense of camaraderie and solidarity between all our knights is our first line of defense against the enemy. Approved Language: "That was wonderful! I've never had a battle experience like that before!" Note: Avoid exaggerating your speech to the point where you become overbearing. Your words and tone should simply express a sufficient degree of respect and cordiality towards your fellow knights. Section Nine As guardians of Mondstadt serving as the shield of the Anemo Archon , the Knights of Favonius must set an example for others to follow. Under no circumstances should any knight ever violate the rules and regulations of Mondstadt. If any knight is found to have damaged public property* (or the private property of a citizen of Mondstadt) while not on duty, following a damage assessment, an amount equivalent to the damages caused shall be deducted from the salary and/or bonus of the knight in question. Knights who are minors at the time of the violation, and who therefore do not receive a formal salary, will be penalized with solitary confinement in lieu of a fine, with the period of incarceration to be determined based on the severity of the violation. *The fish and other aquatic life found in Mondstadt's lakes and rivers are classed as public property, and as such must not be destroyed under any circumstances! Section Ten Knights of Favonius should always remain vigilant and exercise due caution when dealing with strangers. Even when dealing with non-hostiles, a knight should clarify to the stranger their rights and responsibilities as an outsider, explaining the rules and customs of Mondstadt in a firm but fair manner. (Amendment 1) Extra scrutiny is required when dealing with visiting diplomats from other nations whose activity gives cause for concern. Section Eleven In the interests of preventing incidents involving wind glider users, Knights of Favonius should also pay close attention to aerial activity in the region. Knights are required to perform spot-checks on users of wind gliders and ensure that the details therein are current and valid. Should you observe any illegal aerial activity with the city, you should shout to the offender at the top of your voice, imploring them to cease gliding immediately. Should they persist, you should take such further action as is necessary to deescalate the situation. Note: Even if the airborne offender is an off-duty member of the Knights of Favonius, this is no cause for leniency. You have full authority to revoke the offending party's gliding license should you deem this to be appropriate course of action. Appendix: Terminology Notes 1. Knightly virtues Refers to the three core virtues of modesty, honesty, and self-control espoused by the Knights of Favonius. The three are mutually reinforcing and treated as a collective. Knights must conduct themselves in accordance with these virtues at all times. 2. Terms of address Refers to the various honorifics used to address members of the public, including visitors to Mondstadt. As public servants to the free people of Mondstadt and hosts to others from beyond our borders, we are expected to use the appropriate terms of address in all encounters as an act of courtesy. An education in etiquette is mandatory for all serving knights. 3. Duty Refers to our responsibilities to serve the people of Mondstadt and protect the freedom of Mondstadt. Officially appointed Knights of Favonius should refrain from talking flippantly or irreverently about their responsibilities or their honor as a knight in their day-to-day lives, so as to preserve the dignity of our organization's reputation. 4. The Anemo Archon (New) The Anemo Archon Barbatos is the God of Wind and Song, the granter and guardian of Mondstadt's freedom, and the one in whom the people of this land place their faith. As an organization, the Knights of Favonius heeds the will of the Anemo Archon. This means that we must be prepared to go to war in the event that Mondstadt's freedom comes under threat. Note: Need to add additional material on this term. Several members of the Knights of Favonius and even the Church seem not to have any belief in the Anemo Archon at all. 5. The Fatui Diplomats and other agents of Snezhnaya stationed here in Mondstadt. They are afforded diplomatic immunity within our borders. Their activities are shrouded in mystery and deceit, and their intentions are obscure. Warning: Always be wary around members of the Fatui. If you observe any suspicious activity, report it to headquarters immediately while taking care to prioritize your personal safety. 6. The Abyss Order An ancient, mysterious group of enemies from the abyss. No one knows how they came to be or what they seek. Occasionally, they can be spotted causing trouble near Mondstadt. Warning: Members of the Abyss Order are highly dangerous enemies. If you encounter one, exercise extreme caution and report its location and activity to headquarters as soon as possible. 7. Stormterror's Lair (New) Refers to the ruins that lie to the northwest of Mondstadt. Legend holds that this area was once a city where a tyrant ruled from his tower. It has since been occupied by Dvalin , who shelters himself there. For this reason, these ruins have now been named "Stormterror's Lair."When our perceptions are unfettered by archons and churches, we shall learn that in northern Teyvat, the people of Mondstadt preserved their culture as decades ago, even after Barbatos the Anemo Archon concealed himself. When we observe the daily lives of the people of Mondstadt from a higher perspective, it is evident that the people share a carefree nature, which mostly stems from their bountiful and pleasant living conditions. The surplus grain produced became their source of brews, and the brews further nourished their easygoing temperament. Above all, the Anemo Archon never taught them how to make wine and revel — they discovered it themselves. But I do not intend to make my readers think that we could do without archons. On the contrary, say, if Barbatos had not guided the warm monsoons to Mondstadt with his divine powers, would Mondstadt still be so bountiful as to produce the brews that it does? The answer would be no. Mondstadt is an inland city and would have struggled to provide for itself if not for the grace of Barbatos. If we look back through history, we learn that Mondstadt is situated on a land that was once frozen, where the living conditions were harsh and brewing would be virtually impossible. It was the power of Barbatos that changed everything. A cumbersome preface indeed, but I hope that my readers will keep one thing in mind when reading my humble book: while it is the power of archons that created our living environment, we should be conscious of the fact that what shapes our thinking, logic, culture, philosophy and aesthetics is not the archons themselves, but the objective environment that exists around us. This world around us is what we have inherited, and what this book shows is that the people of Teyvat have always been, and always will be, heirs to a divine legacy — but not to divinity itself.In the beginning, Rex Lapis descended. He lowered the tides, raised Mt. Tianheng , and calmed the waves. Thereupon, peace was brought to the people. They cut into the mountain and found jade, they bored through the rock and made tunnels, and they piled up stones and built a settlement. It is written that the jade from the bowels of the mountain is that which glows. Hence, they named it "Shanhui Fort"1. In that time, all the people of Tianheng derived their livelihood from the mines, all prospered from them, and none knew poverty within a thousand-mile radius. 1 Better known today as "Shanhui Rock," which is often simplified to "Mountain Rock," thereby stripping the name of most of its original meaning. &#91; Note 1 &#93; ... Guizhong , the Lord of Dust, was an ally to the Lord of Rock. Around Mt. Tianheng, Guizhong set up a Crossbow to keep guard, and it was named the " Guizhong Ballista ." She brought her people to the north of Mt. Tianheng and taught them to tend the soil. Agriculture became their livelihood, and all prospered from it. The farming towns stretched for miles, and it was said that one could walk all the way to Stone Gate without ever leaving the network of pathways between the fields. Guizhong said to the Lord of Rock: "My people had left their home and came to this place. Here, they are happy in their abodes and content in their work, thus it is as if they have returned home. Hence, what better name to call this place than 'the Plains of the Returning and Departing?'" The Lord of Rock praised the Lord of Dust for her work, and thereafter the area was named in the tongue of Liyue " Guili Plains ." 2 It later came to pass that the gods each strove for dominance , which brought catastrophe upon the land. Though the adepti fought to protect the Guili Plains, they could not stop the tide of war, which ravaged the plains and took the life of its ruler, Guizhong. Thereupon, the Lord of Rock Rex Lapis took his people south of Mt. Tianheng. Thus the people departed from the Guili Plains for good, never to return, and it was left to become a wilderness. ... Rex Lapis pacified the gods, adepti and yakshas were content in their positions, and Liyue re-entered an era of peace. Before this time, the gods waged war for centuries on end, &#91; Note 2 &#93; and not one field was left unravaged. The people of Liyue turned to commerce and artisanship for their livelihood, and prospered once more. Those who prospered above the rest joined, calling themselves the Qixing . Thus was formed the framework around which Liyue Harbor developed. Under the jurisdiction of the Qixing were all the known trades, &#91; Note 3 &#93; no business of Liyue took place inside or outside the nation that was not known unto them. The Millelith also took orders from the Qixing, supporting the masses at home and suppressing the monsters at the border. &#91; Note 4 &#93; Thus became the nature of Liyue's governance under Rex Lapis. Notes xe2x86x91 Shanhui Fort ( Chinese : xe5xb1xb1xe8xbex89xe7xa0xa6 Shxc4x81nhuxc4xab Zhxc3xa0i , "Mountain Splendor Fort" ) had xe7xa0xa6 "Fort" simplified into xe5xb2xa9 "Rock," turning the name into Shanhui Rock ( Chinese : xe5xb1xb1xe8xbex89xe5xb2xa9 Shxc4x81nhuxc4xab Yxc3xa1n , "Mountain Splendor Cliff, Rock" ). People then dropped the xe8xbex89 Huxc4xab , "Splendor," turning the name into Mountain Rock ( Chinese : xe5xb1xb1xe5xb2xa9 Shxc4x81n Yxc3xa1n ). xe2x86x91 In the original Chinese text, the phrase translated as "centuries on end" (meaning hundreds of years) is xe5x8dx83xe5xb9xb4 "millennia, thousand(s) of years, a very long time." It is impossible with current information to know the full duration of the Archon War, but it indeed lasted over 1700 years. xe2x86x91 In the original Chinese text, "all the known trades" are explicitly referred to as the Eight Trades ( Chinese : xe5x85xabxe9x97xa8 "Eight Gates" ). The Chinese text reads: xe4xb8x83xe6x98x9fxe4xb8x8bxe8xbex96xe5x8fx88xe6x9cx89xe5x85xabxe9x97xa8xefxbcx8cxe5x86x85xe5xa4x96xe8xafxb8xe4xb8x9axe6x97xa0xe6x89x80xe4xb8x8dxe5x8cx85xe3x80x82 "Under the administration of the Qixing are the Eight Trades Eight Gates, and between them all trades, whether domestic or foreign, are accounted for." xe2x86x91 The phrase "suppressing the monsters at the border" ( Chinese : xe5xa4x96xe9x95x87xe5xa6x96xe9xadx94 ) is better translated as "suppressing demons outside the city's walls," as the Millelith were not exclusively located at the border (between nations) as the English translation implies.

all the elements in the land, Geo alone stands fast, Built on a bedrock of proud tradition, which doth make it last. For just is the law of Rex Lapis , and ineffable His wisdom — The cornerstones of justice, which prevails throughout His kingdom. Slayer of foul demons, no evil would He leave unquenched. He sought celestial order, to stay the tide of turbulence. Adepti rallied round Him, yaksha guardians charged ahead, Frightened by the courageous people the demons fled. The Lord then fashioned mighty rocks, which into the earth He cast: The sea monster subdued, peace returned at last! Though demons lay defeated, their souls did plot revenge. Down into the watery abyss the demonic souls did descend. Hatred fueled their rage. Rage, in turn, did blunt their mind, Their folly sullied the seas, whence the demons multiplied: A demonic infestation thus engendered by the fallen souls. Five yaksha guardians His Majesty task'd with evil to defeat, To rid the world of poisonous rage with which the demons seethed. Mountains shook as yaksha wrath with golden splendor burned, But though they purged the evil, alas! One alone returned: Alatus , by whose talons foes were quashed and peace procured. A peace that harked to days gone by was the peace that now endured. Peace restored, adepti back to Jueyun Karst ascended. Duty fulfilled, yakshas off to unknown corners departed. May this lowly offering departed souls appease. And may these words by fire's light His Majesty's heart please.During the time of the aristocracy , the tyrants who ruled Mondstadt spurned the study of history and forbade the people from speech and song that alluded to historical events. For they knew the extent of their own degeneracy, and wished not for their deeds to be held to scrutiny by the annals of history alongside tales of heroes' honor and glory. But the winds of history blow strong, and ultimately no wall could be built tall enough to stay them. This work is a collection of all poems, songs, and legends that have survived from the aristocratic period, interspersed with archaeologists' commentary. Its purpose is to provide a new account of Mondstadt's history from the Age of Kings all the way through to the fall of the Aristocracy. A degree of historical inaccuracy is inevitable, given that certain details are impossible to verify. We can but humbly hope that this work might elucidate the past for those who come after us, or perhaps inspire them to further investigate the facts of history on their own. This work is divided into three sections: Section 1, "The Stormlord of the Tower and the Kingwolf of Boreas " covers the struggle between the Kings of Ice and Frost prior to Barbatos ' arrival. Section 2, "The Cultivation of Mondstadt," covers Mondstadt's ancestors, including the aristocrats' predecessors, in the period during which agriculture developed. Section 3, "Tyrants, Heirs, and Rebels," covers the long reign of the Aristocracy in Mondstadt. The reader may wish for this work to serve as a cautionary tale to future generations. In fact, it was compiled with such ambition in mind. The freedom bestowed upon us by Barbatos is also the freedom that allows us to cast off the shackles of the past in search of the truth. My only hope is that this work, in a spirit of openness and truth, may finally share with the reader those stories which it was forbidden to share in the past.A story written by Chang the Ninth . It tells the tale of a young man, frail since birth, who was adopted by a Guhua Master from the mountains. Though the boy could not practice the Guhua arts, his whole life revolved around them as he grew up in the school. After the decline of the Guhua Clan and the death of the Master, the boy and an elderly caretaker were the sole remaining disciples of the school. But the boy didn't give up, mastering all the esoteric techniques and reading every last book hidden there. Running the school single-handedly as the previous master had before him, the young man defeated countless challengers with neither Vision nor arcane weapon... He also took a young girl from Inazuma as his student. When tumultuous times beset the world, and the girl from Inazuma left without saying goodbye, the young man decided it was time for him to explore the world beyond the mountain — starting, of course, with the distant land of Inazuma...The phrase "time and wind" seems like it may have something to do with the Anemo Archon ... But couldn't he have been clearer? What am I supposed to figure out with just these three words? If it has something to do with the Anemo Archon, then whatever clues may be found should also be related to Anemo . Then if one factors in the idea of "time"... This sundial over here should hide some secret. Moreover, I do get an odd feeling around this place sometimes. I think it might have been 2 AM... Or was it some other time...? I really can't remember... I only remember that sometime before dawn , the shadow cast by the sundial's pointer points right below it . But... Well, fine. The lecturers at the Akademiya used to say that it would be best for people without Visions not to take part in practicum such as outdoor surveys. I didn't understand what they meant then, but I suppose I do now. Even though I did find a clue, all I could do without a Vision was watch. I wonder if the Adventurers' Guild can help me find someone who has a Vision and is willing to help. Speaking of which, why is Mondstadt 's Adventurers' Guild still so tiny?

Cats are good, cats are great. Cats love to meow and scratch their heads. From the two bright eyes they use to see, hateful pests can never flee! Manager Xiao The shipyard overseer goes for a doze, his sleep so deep with a great big snore. From far, you'd think the Geo Lord had stomach woes, but up close he sounds like a large wild boar. Ocean-gazing As I feast my eyes upon the sea, to azure water my heart is drawn. The oars of yon ships appear unto me like the many limbs of a gigantic prawn. Ocean-gazing Yet Again Day after day, I gaze and I gaze till my eyes are weary and my heart is numb. Year upon year, I write and recite, but I am to my poems an audience of one. Time after time, ships will set sail like brave little river fish bound for the sea. Sooner or later, the tides they will turn and drown out the ones who dismiss poetry. The Streets by Night A delightful sight is the star-like light from the lamps on the street with the myriad eats. But alas, no respite from that poor little tyke named Changchang , whose weeping is hardly discreet. Mt. Tianheng Tianheng is big, Tianheng is tall, Tianheng is huge like a great city wall. Too strong for monsters, bandits, and all. What a great big huge tall strong city wall! Spring by the Harbor These silken flora that blossom in spring, their flowers seem woven of some thread within... It feels like it's silk, but it has a faint smell — could it be both silk and a flower as well? An Ode to Chop Suey My Zhongyuan Chop Suey is going to waste, there's far more salt in here than I care to taste. Just one mouthful in and I'm gasping for breath. "Why is this so salty?" I gently protest. "That's just how we make it," declares Su Er'niang , "For the few that can't take it, there's plenty who can!"

knew naught but plague in antiquity. The warmongering gods made it so, for the vanquished were crushed under the rocks, and there they rotted and became soil. Thus were they returned to the cycle of Elements , which doth span both Heaven and Earth, and which knows no end. But some souls held on to their hatred and took on flesh once more as daemons. The daemons rose up in anger, giving rise to a miasma, which in turn engendered all manner of plagues, monsters and other perverse evils. They starved the earth and churned the waters, and wrought devastation on the people. Therefore, it is said: The daemonic is the shadow of the divine. "Liyue suffered many outbreaks of disease in ancient times. Some say this was caused by the chaos of the relentless warring between gods. The defeated were squashed beneath the rocks of the earth, where they decomposed and became soil, and finally re-entered the everlasting elemental cycle. Some of the gods' souls were filled with bitterness at their fate, and refused to suffer it any longer. Their bitterness materialized and became evil monsters. The monsters' rage manifested itself in the form of diseases, monster infestations, and all kinds of other strange occurrences. The monsters ravaged the land and turned it into a wilderness, and unleashed all manner of evil upon the rivers and seas. They inflicted untold suffering on the people. Hence, what we call monsters are in fact physical manifestations of the resentment of gods defeated in war." Rex Lapis summoned yakshas unto him to purge the daemons. Illuminated beasts of dreadful appearance and warlike temperament were they, and no brutality did they spare in their duty to defend. Of the many, five were the strongest: Bosacius , Indarias , Bonanus , Menogias , and Alatus . Wherever battle took Rex Lapis, so too did they follow, until the plague was purged. The five are known unto mortals as "The Yakshas." "Rex Lapis summoned yakshas to help him destroy the monsters. The yakshas were illuminated beasts of Liyue. Ferocious and intimidating to behold, they were violent by nature and formidable in battle, ready to kill mercilessly to defend Rex Lapis' rule. Among the yakshas, five were known as the strongest: Bosacius, Indarias, Bonanus, Menogias, and Alatus. The five followed Rex Lapis into battle countless times, finally wiping out the evil at its source. They became known throughout the world simply as 'The Yakshas'." "The Yakshas" were guardians of Rex Lapis for years without measure, and the evils they vanquished were incalculable. Yet, mighty though they were, beyond the torment that betide all who face war the yakshas were not, and they became afflicted. Some were given unto their rage, others unto a madness which fear mongered. Many turned to the slaughter of their own, others were bewitched by shadows of the soul. After a millennium did fate present itself unto them, and it was such: three of the five perished, the fourth vanished, and all of the myriad shared the fate of the three or the fourth. The fifth alone prevailed, and the fifth was Alatus. "'The Yakshas' faithfully protected Rex Lapis and pacified all manner of catastrophes in the world. This continued for many years. But there came a day when the yakshas, despite their might, found that their deeds had taken their toll, and that the remnants of divine bitterness had begun to poison them. Some descended into a blind rage of a kind that cannot be put into words, or were driven by fear to equally indescribable madness. Some turned on and destroyed each other. Some were lost to delusions of the mind. After a thousand years' scourges, three of the five were slain, and one disappeared. Many other yakshas of unknown name also either died or fled. In the end, only one of the five, Alatus, survived." Alatus is the Golden-Winged King who is also the Conqueror of Demons. None knows whence he came, nor whither he went. Only at springtime, during the offering of lanterns at night, might the people see the glow at Guyun and declare: "Behold, the Vigilant Yaksha ends the dominion of daemons!" Or they might hear the sound of a flute amongst the marsh reeds, but find none who play the flute, and thus declare: "Hark, the yaksha calls to summon his old friends to their homeland." "Alatus is also known as the Golden-Winged King, or alternatively as the Conqueror of Demons. Nobody knows where he came from, and nobody knows where he went. In spring of each year, when the Lantern Rite festival arrives, Liyue people will gaze at the glow in the air above Guyun Stone Forest, and say: 'Behold, the Guardian Yaksha ends the dominion of demons.' Some hear a sound like a flute coming from Dihua Marsh , but when they enter the marsh there is no flutist to be found. They say: 'Hark, the yaksha calls to summon his old friends to their homeland.'" Thus, divine endowment doth carry with it that ultimate and unbreakable trial: to lose kin, friend, or ally, to face the impossibility of redemption, to burn in everlasting anger and know no respite. To become the foe of an ancient evil was to abandon hope of both reward and resolution in his endeavors, and his torment was that of the preta, which is to be without satiety after ten thousand fates. "For this reason, it is said that the wages of being blessed with supernatural power is a destiny of hardship and eventual destruction. For the yaksha lost all his friends, family, and those he fought alongside. He built up an incalculable karmic debt from the violent deeds his life necessitated, and the consequence was a heart filled with darkness and hatred from which there was no rest. There was no reward to be gained from making an enemy of his own bitterness and hatred from the old days, nor was there any escape from the unbearable suffering. The torment ate away at his heart like an insatiable wolf, and an infinite number of lifetimes could have done nothing to reduce it."

Version 0.7.1 Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti was available in CBT2 with the following text: Liyue knew naught but plague in antiquity. The warmongering archons made it so, for the defeated were trapped under the rocks and became pressed, and the pressed rotted and became soil. Thus were they returned to the cycle of Elements, which doth span both Heaven and Earth, and which knows no end. Embittered arcane souls did rebel and became flesh once more , but their fleshy form was that of daemons. The burning in anger of the daemons gave rise to miasma, which in turn engendered all manner of plagues, daemons and other perverse evils. They starved the earth and boiled the waters, and wrought devastation on the people. Therefore, it is said: The daemonic is the echo of that which was defeated in the divine. "Liyue suffered many outbreaks of disease in ancient times. Some say this was caused by the chaos of the relentless warring between archons.

Commerce and trade, like springs and streams, begin with the mountains and end with the seas. The penchant of people is to pursue profit, and when people turn their means to profitable ends, wealth is created. To possess means is to possess power, and to curb the unjust excesses of power, we restrain it with contracts to guide all things to prosper together. The strong should not bully the weak, nor should weakness be despised and strength glorified. Let it be known to all that trade and commerce allows the river of gold to flow unimpeded along its natural course — this is the just and upright way. Some say: "There are those who lose their jobs and have no reliable source of food, nor a roof over their heads, they toil in vain in their barren fields. All the while, the wealthy merchants' residences overflow with gold and jade. What justice and uprightness is this?" This question is devoid of insight. Like the waves that face off against the golden sands of the shoreline, the pursuit of profit topples much of what stands in its way, and like the rapids that run in the valleys, it is unrelenting. Thus those in poverty will not stay poor forever, just as the wealthy shall not hold onto their riches for eternity — but the treasury must always be filled for the nation to remain peaceful and prosperous. Hence, it is the proper way of things to eschew prohibition, expand the economy, and reform the government. It is easy to succumb to complacency in the matter of aid, but this must not become the trend and should be curtailed. The Millelith should be expanded to pacify unrest, both the bandits at our borders and the citizens who reside within them. ... Though Rex Lapis enjoys immortality, mortals require provisions and preparation to be free of worry. This grand plan charts the course that will lead us, slowly but surely, to Liyue's longevity and the people's prosperity. The task of reform is one that should be undertaken with patience, we cannot make rash, demands lest we overlook other concerns. Just as one who carves by candlelight patiently waits for the jade to take shape, so will it take time for the myriad affairs of Liyue to be gradually settled.The words on this sundial seem to follow on from the one by the Thousand Winds Temple. Taken together, the four lines then deliver the complete message. This place and the Thousand Winds Temple must have something to do with a god of Time . How ironic that the ravages of "Time" have devoured all trace of the god who supposedly presided over it... Also — the literature says that some ancient thinkers believed the Anemo Archon to have some sort of connection with this god... If that's true, there must be some evidence of that here somewhere... Generally that would be in the form of elemental evidence... Also, it definitely feels particularly strange around here at a certain time of the day. Starts around 2 AM, and is over by 5 AM at the latest... There is this sundial here, after all, and in the early hours of the day the blade's shadow fall directly downwards . It's quite striking, which is why it stands out in my memory. But I'm no Vision holder. So while I can tell that's something's up and theorize about what the cause might be, there's no way for me to investigate it properly. Honestly, these days... trying to be an academic when you don't have a Vision , it's really restricting...

gliding, make sure you are physically and mentally prepared. Make use of a wind current or elevated terrain for take off. Keep an eye on the wind conditions while gliding to maintain steady balance. Pay attention to air traffic conditions and only use a wind glider while the date on your gliding license remains valid. Keep your balance while gliding and retract the wind glider at a safe altitude. Don't drink and glide! Violation Cases To make his daughter happy, a Mondstadt civilian named Rudolf jumped from his two-story house, resulting in the fracturing of his left leg and a contusion to his buttocks. This accident could have cost Lily her father. Rudolf received a warning ticket and had his gliding license suspended for one year. A tourist named Alice summoned a wind current at Windrise by blasting an Anemo Slime and used it to quickly climb great heights with a wind glider. The legendary adventurer performed a series of aerobatic stunts in the skies above Mondstadt. Her performance earned a big round of applause from the crowd. However, Jean, the Acting Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius, summoned her and gave her a 10-day detention. To show off his self-proclaimed lyre playing skills, Josxc3xa9 the bard tried to play the lyre while using a wind glider and insisted on singing the long sonnet he had just finished. After ten minutes of mumbling and unbearable lyre tune, the Six-Fingered Josxc3xa9, who is acclaimed as the bard no worse than Barbatos, fell into the wishing well head first before half of the civilians of Mondstadt. Luckily, Barbatos always pays extra care to those with little self-awareness. Although the lyre and the wind glider were badly damaged, the bard himself suffered only minor bruising. Josxc3xa9 got his gliding license suspended for five years for reckless gliding and had to perform community service for three months.

the end of a duel across a multitude of worlds, Upon the domes of many a sky, this supreme rite unfolded in the most unexpected way: "My apologies, friend, but a 'grand finale,' or so they say, almost always ends this way." The other duelist descended the Stairs of Arcane Rites, removing the crocodile mask and revealing the prussian green complexion beneath, his features equally somber... Abu froze at the sight while drawing the cards out from the Casket of Tomes. Voice your grievances, vent your fury, insult me with your bitter sarcasm — so thought the one who had just taken off his mask. But the young man just went on to take out the cards before placing them gently on the table. Then, he said: "If all finales shall end thusly, I'll gladly have this, for I've always wanted to duel with you." "Boss, will Abu win?" One of the sailors asked as the stench of dried fish permeated the ocean breeze. The unfettered figure sitting among them was none other than Dubbah, the lord of the seven seas, who had claimed such ownership through the Rite of Duels. The man raised his goblet against the chill moon, blue light dancing on it. "Should he lose, I will twist off his head as promised. But it's a pity that the wine from such a new vessel definitely won't taste as good..." "Ugh, look at what he just rolled... Well, seems like lady luck's shining the other way. Honestly, why didn't he use the trick I told him..." "But no cheating can pass unnoticed in the Room of Duels. It's more practical to have a few cards for dice-conversion in your deck," said the little Kitsune as she approached with a tray of dishes. "This is exactly why Abu didn't want to learn the trick, and it's also why you ended up working here, a far cry from when you were the owner of the Collectors' Parlor... Oh yes, Cui, this is the fish soup for Table 17. Remember to serve it before it gets cold." "Fine, got it," replied the young girl as she rose from the table, but her eyes were still focused on the figures cast in the sky. "Not... working... I can't get it connected." The dark-haired girl hid her face within the hood, electric arcs dancing around her fingers. Yet, one by one, the dice hovering around her broke and scattered, as if being warned by something. "The Room of Duels is... Well, it's just like another Sacred Realm." "Huh, still not giving up, are we? Forget about it already. Given how even the Crocodile King failed to escape from that place, I'd be shocked if you could succeed, Nimue. I'd rather put faith in that lad — it's a long shot, though." Commented the Knightly King of Duels, Ariatos. It seemed that the knight couldn't care less about the possible death of his friend, who had helped the knight restore his homeland. "...But how can I not feel a bit jealous, Abu, when your rival is the Crocodile King?" It would be a good ending if the young man turned the tables miraculously. The game was already decided in the last round. Even the lord of combat — one who had been sealed here by the Ibis King for craving a grander war and attempting to erase the walls of the worlds — should be abandoned by combat itself. As in all other underdog stories, the young man, Abu, claimed victory. "Name your wish..." Said the Crocodile King, trying to hide the fact that his body was beyond repair and on the verge of death. Abu tilted his head, watching as the king's body gradually crumbled into ashes. "Though you live off war, not one day have you stopped quenching its flame," said the young man. He lowered his head. This would be too boring, said Abu, the world would be so boring without you. To me, you are... You won't understand. Oh, by the way, it just occurred to me that I don't know your name yet. The Crocodile King saw an unfamiliar, dangerous smile forming on the young man's lips. That day, various worlds bore witness to the young man's wish: "Let the walls shatter, and the war between worlds begin. I want rivers of blood to stain the earth crimson and mountains of bones to pierce through the sky." "Thus shall the lord of duels endure!" — King of Invokations #1, Grand Ending! —Sangonomiya was once an ocean abyss, until the Great Serpent came, forming a vortex with its spiral movements, and fashioning the coral into an island. Thus the people of Sangonomiya named their island Watatsumi, meaning " god of the sea," for the Great Serpent was their god. The inhabitants of Watatsumi call themselves the people of the sea and worship the Great Serpent as the Orobashi no Mikoto. On Watatsumi Island, the shrine is the seat of government, and there are no commissioners appointed by the Shogunate. All business, great and small, is conducted by the shrine maidens. The head shrine maiden, or Divine Priestess, is the head of government and ceremonial affairs. During the Archon War , Her Excellency the Almighty Raiden Ogosho brought all of Inazuma under Her unified rule. The masses bowed down in fear and awe and each was content with their lot, else they were annihilated. No longer did any covet that to which they were not entitled. The Great Serpent, Orobashi no Mikoto, had always remained in the western region and respected the boundary between itself and the Narukami , and the two had lived in peace. But now, it suddenly transgressed the boundary and invaded the east without warning. The war was brutal, and brought great suffering to the people. The two sides fought bitterly on what is now known as Yashiori Island , with many casualties and injuries on both sides. Her Excellency's cherished tengu general, Sasayuri , was among those who lost their lives. Finally, the Great Serpent was slain by the Ogosho where its remains now lie on Yashiori Island . Thereafter, Sangonomiya sent envoys to announce surrender, and they have recognized the Inazuma Shogunate as the legitimate and supreme ruler ever since. Book Location ContextThe version of this tale most widely accepted by the people of both Narukami and Watatsumi Island reads as follows: Around two thousand years ago, the Archon War was drawing to a close in Inazuma . It is said that during this time, the Great Serpent Orobashi broke the coral branches off his body and guided the people of the deep sea back to the light of day, and by his grace and pity, he gathered them together to make a living upon the barren island of coral. But in this world of fickle fortune, humans, puny as they are, often suffered on account of their bitter lives and were gloomy because of their pain and misfortune. The bright sun, the clear skies, and seas, the clam palace that glittered with rainbow light, the teachings of the clergy... None of these could assuage the wounds of hunger and disease. The Great Serpent never forgot his past as one of the defeated, or his oath to never again allow his people to be forsaken. So he asked the shrine maiden: "Blessed daughter of mine, why do the people of the deep sea weep? Have I not defeated the Dragonheirs of the Depths and given you the light of day?" The wise shrine maiden replied: "Famine." The Great Serpent asked again: "Indeed, it is my failing that has caused you to go hungry. What then, my people, is your request?" The honest elders replied: "You made a road for us, guiding us to create a nation amidst the blue seas with no need for robbery, oppression, or tyranny. For this, we are already more than grateful... Yet, to the east of our coral island, there are lands wider and more fertile still." "Permit us, great lord, to set foot upon those islands and there carve out a dominion for ourselves, that our children after us shall have a glorious past, a future in fullness, and a present without darkness." The Great Serpent was silent and made no reply. Narukami it was that dominated the eastern islands, possessing great strength in war, and those deities defeated thus were all slain to the last, in accordance with the law of the divine realm . But in the many years that followed, the hungry and diseased people would ask time and again, at last moving the heart of their god. Thus did the Great Serpent train them to become mighty warriors who commandeered ships and sea monsters while mastering wave and cloud, leading them in an invasion of the Electro Archon 's lands amidst the whistling of whalesongs... But the people of the sea knew not that Watatsumi Omikami had embarked upon a violent campaign in which he had no hope of victory, and his purpose was not conquest, but sacrifice. It is said that there were inscriptions which the shrine maiden hid, upon which were written a prophecy of the certain defeat and the future of humiliation that awaited this eastern expedition. Orobashi's true motives are not well-recorded by history. This is merely a hypothesis drawn by those who discovered the inscriptions in latter days: Watatsumi Omikami long knew that he would not have any chance of survival this time, but accepted the prophecy's result calmly. If he wished to ensure the perpetuation of his people's "faith," there was but one path — sacrifice. Even if Watatsumi would pass away, its people would endlessly weave their memories of joy, prosperity, bitterness, and loss into a united faith. These memories, in turn, would flourish on account of the intense emotions of a vanquished people forced into shameful submission. Many among the Watatsumi people now no longer believe that their guiding Omikami has any chance of revival, but their pride as Watatsumi's people, the pain of watching the body of their god carved up for minerals by their overlord, the hurt of losing that god... These emotions have passed on from generation to generation, becoming the pillars of forbearance, resistance, and sacrifice that underpin the faith of Watatsumi's people. As the author has mentioned, Sangonomiya has an extreme lack of written historical material. As such, these past motives have all essentially become fictional tales upon which future generations can inscribe any meaning they wish. Thus, these histories have become "histories of accumulated consciousness" rather than "histories of recorded fact." The fact that this collective consciousness has been strengthened and rendered ever more cohesive over time, such that a people who have lost their beloved god may still actively resist a nation whose faith is in a mighty elemental deity... This just goes to show that their persistence is hardly some obsolete thing. Notably, this tendency to give little thought to the "facts" of the past and emphasize the "consciousness" of the present is a glaring flaw in Watatsumi today. The flames of these hatreds and humiliations, borne and nursed over hundreds and thousands of years, can be fanned by those with an agenda in leaner years and ultimately bring catastrophe upon the nation. But though I say this, while the people of Watatsumi are known for their forbearance, are they really to grin and bear this mortification endlessly for the sake of survival? With their recent economic exploitation at the hands of the Kanjou Commission , more and more of the young people of Watatsumi Island are discussing resistance and their complaints. It seems evident to me that these discussions are not merely about the past, but about the present and future also. However, there is another version of the legend of Watatsumi Omikami's slaying: While the people of the deep yet dwelt in the depths, they kept very reliable chronicles, for there was no day or night for them. If they kept no precise records, they would even forget what time it was. But these chronicles were ordered sealed in Enkanomiya by the Great Serpent, never to be retrieved. The names of the people of Watatsumi were also not written in the Inazuman style then. The names and surnames used today by them came about by order of the Great Serpent, who had them learn the traditions of Narukami. It is said that when Watatsumi Omikami decided to bring the people of the depths out of the waters, he did this at the instruction of the heavens themselves. For Watatsumi Omikami had once fled into the Dark Sea to avoid the Archon War, committing a grave sin in the process. Thus perhaps it was upon heaven's order that Orobashi went to his death — though this cannot be known for sure. Unfortunately, the script once used in Enkanomiya is known to few, and the books themselves have been hidden there also. Thus, I fear that the truth of the matter shall never see the light of day. However, these legends that hint at the "truth" are but unimportant anecdotes compared to the aforementioned ones that imply much about the "consciousness" of the people. Location Map location Additional contextThe shrine maiden Mouun was born to the Yuna Clan . This clan was one of the great houses that first followed their Omikami out into the sunlight, and is still known today for their traditional talent in whalesongs and their closeness with all marine life. Mouun entered Sangonomiya Shrine at a young age and would learn the etiquette and ritual arts of the Watatsumi shrine maidens, history, governance, and the island folk-tunes. Her younger twin sister Ayame , who in later days would be known as "Umigozen," was a female diver, making a living through collecting pearls. By the time news that the Shogunate had unified all the Inazuman islands reached Watatsumi, Mouun and Ayame were already quite famous among the island's people. In the folk-tunes that still persist till today, Mouun was a wise and gentle soul who helped to steer the people away from meaningless conflict, while Ayame was valiant and cheerful, her power sufficient to wrestle against fierce sea creatures. When Watatsumi Omikami ceased in his hesitation and embarked on that hopeless eastern expedition, Sangonomiya's first navy was entrusted by the then-Divine Priestess to Mouun and her sister. This was also the beginning of Mouun's association with the giant whale named "Daikengyou." Legend has it that Daikengyou was a huge blind whale that had lived for five hundred years and four hundred years before that. The dark depths of the ocean floor were its home, and the fishes of the deep and the moonglow-beauteous jellyfish were its faithful servants. Five hundred narwhals guarded its left flank and five hundred humpback whales played music to its right. Some folk-tunes claim that it could have swallowed ten coral islands in one gulp before spitting out five skerries in its deep, satiated slumber. Even amongst those of the Watatsumi people who were skilled in whalesong, none had faced this titan and returned whole to tell the tale. But at the Divine Priestess' direction, Mouun dived deep into the whale's phosphorescent palace just as the moon rose high enough to pierce the ocean mists. None knew how Mouun persuaded Daikengyou to join her. But on the third moonrise after her departure, when the waves drew back from the shore, the people witnessed Daikengyou surface from the tranquil ocean, shimmering with silver light as it bore Mouun on its back. Later, Daikengyou and its marine courtiers would follow Mouun and her sister into battle at Omikami's side, though the battle ultimately and inexorably went ill...Mouun made to retreat when she heard that Omikami and Touzannou had been slain together, but she was ambushed by the tengu Sasayuri 's subordinates en route and was herself slain together with Daikengyou the mighty whale, their remains captured by the Shogunate. As for her sister, "Umigozen" Ayame, she disappeared into the blood-red ocean after a valiant stand, never to be seen again.

's name is not known, but it is known that he was of low birth, such that some island folk-tunes name him "the legacy of moonlight and tide," or "the forgotten child of the moonlight." Perhaps he was an orphan, or perhaps he was the child of people who had been washed ashore by the sea. But though he had neither name nor surname, nor a clan to protect him as he grew, Watatsumi Omikami accepted this child nonetheless, just as he had once accepted the lost people trapped in the depths. This boy later apprenticed himself to Mouun and her sister , learning from them the whalesongs and rites of Watatsumi . His memories were colored by the palace of coral and clam, the shining schools of fish and the rainbow-hued mackerel, and his body was tempered by the rugged reefs and endless waves, becoming strong and swift. The songs of the Yuna Clan say that when the boy had grown into a young man, he was invited by Mouun the shrine maiden to swim together amidst tides lit by moon and stars alike. In the ebb and flow of the entwined lights, the young man sensed the words and emotions of the sea creatures, and hearing the shrine maiden's gentle, mournful whispers, he decided his future course. It is said that after this night-time excursion, the young man comprehended the sword styles known as "Getsumouun" and "Yuushio." Though he would not have any descendants, these sword techniques would be taught amongst the warriors of Watatsumi and passed down from generation to generation, thus never becoming extinct. In Watatsumi Island, which lacks traditions of swordsmanship, these two styles remain effective and practical techniques that can prove perilous to any foe. When Watatsumi Omikami set off on the eastern expedition from which there would be no return, the young man headed up the vanguard and took a place known then to the Watatsumi people as Touzan. &#91; Note 1 &#93; Thus was he given the honorific of Touzannou by Watatsumi Omikami himself. &#91; Note 2 &#93; However, this valiant "king of the eastern mountain" would become known as a brutal, savage "wicked king," or Akuou, to the people of Yashiori Island . &#91; Note 3 &#93; Ultimately, Akuou and his lord were both judged by the Musou no Hitotachi , and Mouun, who once trod upon the waves with him on that moonlit night, was lost amidst a storm of black feathers, her people bewailing her fate. And when the dust settled, things had not turned out as they might have hoped. Notably, people still call outstanding warriors "the scions of Touzannou," although the young and presumptuous Touzannou himself never had the opportunity to join himself to the one he loved, nor would they ever enjoy a peaceful future together. Location Debates on the Viceroy of the East's location Additional contextMysteries creation conceals, the sun and moon omens reveal. Three corners in darkness shrouded, the void by five saints clouded. "The universe has no beginning and no end, and so it was with the land that once was. But this matters not to us, for the land that bears us no longer has anything to do with that eternity without start or ceasing." —So said the lone sage, Aberaku , to the first Sunchild . The Sunchild had long intended to punish Aberaku. Summoning the sage before the throne in this manner was but an additional way of making things difficult for him before detaining him. Legend has it that Aberaku was opened up to wisdom by the Tokoyo Ookami , and was thus able to bring light to Enkanomiya , which had till then never seen the sun. But the Sunchild grew jealous of his talents, thus imprisoning him for life. Yet these children of the sun never considered that had Aberaku not created that underground star, they never would have existed in the first place. "The origin of heaven and earth is like the chicken and egg, and are not dragons and snakes kin?" No sooner had the sage Aberaku uttered these words than he was overthrown by troops lying in ambush. At that time, Enkanomiya had only just been brought some room to breathe by the appearance of the sun. The Dragonheirs loved the dark and shunned the light, and thus could no longer act with impunity. The days when the Dragonheirs would rampage and graze on humanity like so much grass had, at last, come to an end, for the people of Enkanomiya finally had the means to resist. Yet it came to pass that the flaws in human nature would rear their ugly heads even before such outside threats could be quelled. The people chose a Sunchild, crowned him king, and worshiped him, and yet he ruled with a brutal hand, framing the righteous. Unnumbered years would pass before a young child of Enkanomiya would make a wager with his peers. Alone, he would dive beyond the three corners, evading the trail of the Dragonheir, in search of a Dragonbone Flower . But what he found instead within a great cavern was a mighty serpent , one he had never seen before. Somehow, as he gazed upon the serpent's titanic form, the child felt no fear, but instead a kind of kinship. "I am the Profane Serpent. Though my servants are numberless, not one mortal now dwells in my shadow. That I have fallen into this realm, and that we would meet... Perhaps this is fate. You are not one of my people, but you are human nonetheless. Speak your desire, and I shall hear it." "Could you then, perchance, become our god?" Thus did they, human and serpent, go forth to face the royal authority of the Sunchild and the incursions of the Dragonheirs beyond — thus was the curtain raised on the turning of the tide.... "Seek first forgiveness from Narukami in the skies above, and then from Watatsumi on the land below. Then, recite prayers to quench the gods' anger." The aforementioned ritual must be carried out before any sacrifices, exorcisms, blessings or spell-rites can take place. The same holds true for this Cleansing Ritual. The Thunder Sakura were born from grafted Sacred Sakura branches. They are offshoots of Narukami's own spirit and connect the Grand Shrine to all others. In those days, catastrophe rocked the heavens and demons roamed the earth. The land was defiled, ferocious foes abounded, and small devils wreaked havoc. Thus, the branches were broken off at the Grand Shrine and transplanted across the land to cleanse the filth. Years passed, and damage accumulated. The Cleansing Ritual must thus be performed to calm the chaos. The Thunder Sakura purification must take place once every 60 years. The ritual may also be divided into a minor and major cleansing. After performing the minor cleansing a few times, the major cleansing must then be carried out. During the minor cleansing, one must first seek forgiveness from sky and land, tie up a Shimenawa to form a barrier, and recite the "kashikomi." Next, all the filth must be sealed up inside the barrier and the poisoned root nodules must be isolated from any mortal dwelling. Finally, a ward must be used to suppress all the filth. This must be performed separately in five different places on Narukami Island . The purpose of this minor cleansing ritual is to isolate the defilement and thus procure some years of peace. During the major cleansing, one must first seek forgiveness from sky and land. Then five wards representing the eyes, the mouth, the nose, the hands and the feet must be retrieved, destroying the barriers created by the minor cleansing in the process. The filth must then be eradicated by a powerful spell. The purpose of the major cleansing ritual is to wipe out the defilement and to completely eradicate the filth. This is the end of the summary. The details are as follows: (The rest of this text has been rendered unreadable by abrasion, contamination, and other damage.)The doctor said you were gravely ill. Don't worry. I will give everything I have to save you. My heart bleeds whenever I see you getting wearier, your illness beyond treatment. How I wish I could suffer the pain for you... You said you had no regrets in this life and that you only wish for me to take good care of Shenhe. But if you regret nothing, why thetears? I don't know what I've been doing lately. Though I still breathe, I feel like an empty shell. I have read all the ancient texts I couldget my hands on, looking for ways to save you — but it is utterly futile. I finally found it! It was Mingjun! He had kept the book that could save you hidden! I took it and followed its instructions to summon a god and offer a sacrifice... The god appeared. I told him that I was willing to exchange my life for yours. He kept silent and only pointed at our daughter, Shenhe. The god said her fate was to bear the curse of calamity and that she was prone to bring harm to those close to her. The god also said that she might even have been the cause of your death. In that case, I thought I should... I left her in the cave that the god mentioned. Three days have passed, and still, no news. I grow restless from waiting, seized by an ominous feeling... I am sorry, my love. Forgive me! You too, Shenhe — please, forgive me! How stupid I was! How blind! Let me apologize to both of you... in person.

branch family of exorcists used to live in the east of the village, but in around two weeks, the mother died of disease, the young daughter went missing, and shortly after, the father hanged himself on a tree in the yard of his own house. It has been confirmed that traces of an evil god's remains were found in the village. The villagers are panicking as no one is certain whether the evil god's remains are gone for good.

Dodocos must someday ride the wind and the waves and go on an adventure." A gentle and beautiful mother once said that. And just as she had predicted, our Dodoco was so happy when its best friend, Klee, said that she was going to the nation of lightning for an adventure! Of course, Dodoco loves eating delicious food with Klee at Good Hunter, and loves listening to the bards sing. But Dodoco loves counting the stars in the sky and twisting flowers into garlands together with Klee more. After all, all Dodocos long to ride the wind and waves on an adventure. To get to Inazuma, one needs to pass through the wild winds and pass over the great waves. But Dodoco did not fear the howling wind, for that was the blessing of the Anemo Archon. Dodoco did not worry about the rolling waves either, for it was very brave. Of course, Dodoco didn't want Klee to have to brave such dangers. But as bestest friends, they were bound to protect each other. And Dodoco didn't want to be apart from Klee anyway. Without Klee, adventures would be like Sweet Flowers that cannot bloom, lonely and sad things. Even if Dodoco were to cover every inch of Teyvat by land or sea, it would be meaningless. So there was no point hesitating. Dodoco and its best friend Klee were off on an adventure! If they rode on a boat, they wouldn't be able to fly freely in the sky, or swim happily in the sea... But they'd have Klee's smile and Albedo's stories. And that was a good trade! In Inazuma, the nation of lightning, the flowers and grasses are all purple, and the fish and the birds are also purple. Everything is purple! Albedo would probably run out of purple paint trying to paint it all. Unfortunately, he couldn't be around to draw with Klee and Dodoco. Albedo was an adult, after all. And sometimes adults have to do adult-things. Fortunately, Dodoco still had Klee! Klee would often find happy things to do. As long as Dodoco was with Klee, Dodoco would never be bored. Klee also had lots of friends in Inazuma, like (&#8205;&#8203; Mr. Text for male Traveler &#8203;/ &#8203; Miss Text for female Traveler &#8203;&#8205;) Honorary Knight, Paimon, and Yoimiya. And so they all joined Dodoco for the most fun adventure ever in Inazuma! Hooray for adventure! (&#8205;&#8203; Mr. Text for male Traveler &#8203;/ &#8203; Miss Text for female Traveler &#8203;&#8205;) Honorary Knight took Dodoco up the tall, tall Mt. Yougou. When they got to the Sacred Sakura, they were so tired from all that climbing that they fell asleep. And when they woke up, everyone had grown wings like a tengu! Klee's wings were red, Yoimiya's were gold, and (&#8205;&#8203; Mr. Text for male Traveler &#8203;/ &#8203; Miss Text for female Traveler &#8203;&#8205;) Honorary Knight's were blue. As for Paimon... Paimon can fly without wings, so Paimon didn't grow any. Everyone opened their wings up, causing a huge gust of wind to roll forth. Shooom~ And the shrine maiden's hair was all messed up. Oh no, she looked angry! Better run, quick! Ah, adventure truly was fun... But with a *growl*, Klee's stomach started calling out. Oh no! How could they have forgotten? Eating is an important part of adventuring too! Om nom nom nom~ And so everyone ate the onigiri they brought along, and they all had a great time. Dodoco and Paimon finished their share very quickly, and as the very, very full Dodoco looked at Klee's smile, it couldn't help but think— Meeting Klee and the others is the most hap-happiest thing that ever happened to Dodoco! Aether Version Lumine Version Oh, yes. If you are reading this, you too are surely part of this big adventure. Adventuring together, laughing together, enjoying good food together... If you experienced this together with everyone, then you must be their good friend. In which case, you're invited to Yoimiya's fireworks show as well. Aether Version Lumine Version While everyone was happily watching the fireworks, Yoimiya said: "As long as our imaginations don't run dry, our minds will be freer than all others." And Klee blurted out: "We'll always be best friends!" See, Dodoco was so happy to be together with its good friends. And now, you are Dodoco's good friends too. So you, too, should go on a grand adventure with your friends.

back, Almighty Shogun !" Says Yae Masako, who is kneeling on the ground respectfully. She is dressed in a red-white shrine maiden outfit, her fluffy fox ears twitching slightly, and beneath them is a face that all looks up to. "You are back. I asked you to help patrol the territory half a month ago. How's it going then?" "Oops, I shouldn't ask about work when you've just returned. Well, as usual, are you going to have dinner first or take a bath first? Or do you prefer..." "What? 'As usual'? You never greeted me this way when I came back in the past." Hearing my response, the figure dressed in red and white gives a content smile and goes on, "I wanted to cheer you up a bit seeing your tired face. Now, I gotta get back to cooking. I made your favorite Butter Crab today!" "Yay! Butter Crab, my favorite Butter Crab!" I, the Raiden Shogun, whose signature line is "Yay!" and whose favorite food is Butter Crab, spend most of my time with... Um, basically, there are only two kinds of people in my life: nobodies, and the one with fluffy ears and a teasing voice. Yae Masako, Guuji of the Grand Kaminaru Shrine, descendant of Kitsune lineage, and Eternity's servant and friend... She goes by too many names to remember. In the eyes of the people of Inazuma , she is almost as unapproachable and unfathomable as I. Yet that very Yae Masako is intently watching the Butter Crab as it is being baked. Yes, simply put, I, the Raiden Shogun is being looked after by Guuji Yae Masako. Before I knew it, I had already got used to this way of life. Every time I just randomly swing my sword, she'll enthusiastically clap her hands and say: "Good girl!" Every time I look for some snacks to go with "Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden With Unlimited Power," she can always produce delicious milk tea and cake in no time. She carefully extinguishes every flicker of potential annoyance as if she is maintaining Eternity. For me, she is like a kitsune from the legend who grants every wish of mine. "Butter Crab is ready! Before enjoying the food, allow me to get back to our previous question about patrolling..." Masako turns around, setting the steaming-hot Butter Crab on the table, its scent soon permeating the room. But I can't bring myself to answer her question — to be honest, this is the reason why I am so down today. Like I said, there are only Masako and other people in my world. All of them, except Masako, would do the same thing upon seeing me: They would bow to the ground in the most respectful manner and address me as "Almighty Shogun." When I walk away, they will then straighten up with a sigh of relief. It doesn't matter if they are someone's wife, father, boyfriend, or girlfriend, it doesn't matter if they are someone's boss, servant, or hero. They always put on the same face in front of me — one that exhibits the reverence and fear for the Almighty Shogun. Yet none know how I equally fear that very face of theirs. Who wouldn't? Just think about it: thousands of people putting on the same face in your presence. That is why I rely so much on Masako. That is why I couldn't reject her request. Although I can't do it, I will always go out to work as long as she wants me to.To be honest, I don't know how to deal with those identical faces — thousands of them. I don't want to, and I can't. As long as I get to avoid making contact with them, I don't mind being called a loser Shogun. But still, although I don't mind that, I can't face Masako's questions. "Why are you so quiet, Almighty Shogun? Is it because... you did nothing at all after walking out of Tenshukaku and then came back in the evening?" There was not a trace of reprimand to be heard in Masako's voice, but that made me even more ashamed when facing her questions. "Alright then. Rest is also important. I have other matters to attend to, so I'll excuse myself. Enjoy your fill of the crab." Masako turns around and leaves. Somehow, the Butter Crab today tasted like... nothing. Soon I'll know why. The Almighty Shogun is invincible, but the invincible Almighty Shogun could be defeated by a cold. Not long after I ate the Butter Crab, I collapsed into bed with a severe headache. The pain is nothing, but something more grievous has happened:On any other day, I could just rest my head on Masako's knees and fall asleep to her singing voice. But Masako isn't around today. My chamber feels icy-cold, but my forehead feels fiery-hot. This time, no one is sitting by my bedside. She has her own matters to attend to. She is not only my kitsune but also the Guuji of the shrine. Maybe she is very mad now, or perhaps she is wondering if it is worthwhile to spend so much effort on the Shogun who always has the line "Yay!" upon her lips. With such a question in mind, I fall asleep. I have a dream, in which Masako is still wearing her signature smile, a tea bowl in hand. "I brewed this drink called Rainbow Aster . I just went to Ritou and bought some Calla Lilies from Mondstadt . Mix them with mint and we have this drink that can cure your cold. Now drink it." Perhaps because I am dreaming, I don't have the strength to brace myself up. "Ah, looks like you can't support yourself. Allow me." She feeds me the Rainbow Aster in a way that I'd never dare to imagine. I wake with a start, my head still reeling from the sheer shock of the scene just now. Masako is probably still mad at me for slacking off. It's just... Why does it feel so sweet at the corner of my lips?Such is life. Mom and Dad always tell me to know right from wrong, but the reality is that we are always choosing the lesser of two evils. My girlfriend has decided to break up with me. Not only that, but she also got me fired by telling my supervisor that I have a gambling addiction. Funny how I actually don't have much money to burn because I have protection fees to pay. Failure to do so and anything could happen to my parents. My parents, however, think I am a loser who could neither find a serious job nor save up any Mora. That's rather ironic, considering who I am doing this for... How is it my fault? If it is, I blame myself for my incompetence to find a way out after all the struggles and also my lack of courage to end it once and for all. Forget it. Just hand them the money when they arrive. After that I really need to think about how to earn some Mora, or I'll only have seagrass on the dinner table in the future. OK, time to choose between the worse and the worst. A falling blade, or a flying stone — which one is less painful? "Bzzzzz—" I've been hearing strange noises. What's going on... Is the thunder going to strike? ... I wake up not knowing how long I've been unconscious. All I remember is the sharp pain shooting through my body before I passed out. "It doesn't feel very painful... What!?" I scream upon hearing the voice. Is this my voice? "Ah, ah—" So I'm not dreaming. I lift my arm and see pale, soft skin covered in exquisite fabric. This is definitely not my body, but to arrive at this conclusion requires a bold logical leap that my brain isn't yet ready to take. Because it simply doesn't make any sense. I try to stand up to have a better view of my clothes. Every detail is brimming with luxury. The clothes are befitting of the one holding the highest authority. Could it be... "Where is that brat... Huh? This is... the Raiden Shogun !?" The very title itself bears weight. Ah, yes. I got reincarnated as the Raiden Shogun. The Kairagi who came to collect debts have already stood in a formation. Although I cannot see their faces, their gestures convey their level of alertness and also fear. I've never seen them like this. "Come on! I—It's time to take revenge..." He trails off — he's scared. Unwilling to act like a coward in front of his underlings, the man can't just run, but he is also aware of the consequences. More people are gathering, ten, twenty, fifty... Perhaps they think their numbers could make a difference. But the mortals' idea of "outnumbering" simply does not apply to the Raiden Shogun, the wielder of divine powers. "Let me try my blade with you." I take a deep breath, focus my mind, and adopt the fighting stance. My blade shall fall, my destiny, rewritten. "Musou..." ... Wait a moment. How do I unleash Musou no Hitotachi ?Arayama City Arc: Chapter 1 It was that same nightmare again, forcing Yutaka Riko to relive the night when the oni race was destroyed. The dark clouds roared as they closed in, swallowing the village whole. The ink-like flames raged and spread, devouring hundreds of houses all the way to the seaside, causing the seawater to steam and churn, and turning the sand on the shallows into a molten slurry. The chieftain shoved Riko into an underground cellar. The last words she heard still rang in her ears, drowning out the cries of anguish all around. "Kataba Shintetsu has betrayed the oni. It was she who brought about this disaster!" Riko's swordsmanship was taught to her by Shintetsu personally. As far as she could remember, Shintetsu was a demure girl who always wore a faint smile as she talked to others. Until today, Riko still could not accept that her teacher, the sword prodigy respected by all, could have done something so cruel. But yet the symbols and talismans scattered around the village made a convincing counterpoint. The chieftain could not have been mistaken... How should she face Shintetsu? Riko had not yet decided, and could only sigh deeply. The noise startled a nearby white cat, and squinting its two mottled eyes, the cat rubbed the back of Riko's hand. "Sorry, Onigiri. Did I wake you?" Riko brought her wooden bowl out and placed it before the cat. Listening to the soft sounds of it lapping at the water, she looked up at the sky outside her tent. Through the gaps in the leaves could the cliffs and mountains under the moonlight be seen, its silver glow tracing the intricate outlines of buildings on the ridges, forming a unique spectacle. Arayama City lay before her. The towering mountains had all been hollowed out, with a majestic city being built within them. Legend had it that the "people of the mountain" here were the descendants of giants, standing at two times the height of an ordinary person. Even the plants and crops here were larger than anything elsewhere. Moreover, Arayama City's "Arahara Army" was said to be powerful indeed, having fought with the surrounding nations many times while suffering very few defeats. But Arayama City's brutal lord was not satisfied, and would not be till he had achieved absolute dominion. Three days ago, the lord had invited Kataba Shintetsu to join the Arahara Army and train his troops in the swordsmanship that the oni had prided themselves in. Shintetsu had agreed gladly... But regardless of Shintetsu's intentions, Riko's current goal was to find her, defeat her, and mete out the punishment she deserved. Then, she would follow the clues that the chieftain had given her to search for the true teachings of "Shiseidou," and use the magatama within Onigiri's body to revive her tribespeople. Thinking thus, Riko put a little more wood on the fire before lying down her side and entering a shallow slumber, preserving her strength for the battle that would commence the next day. ... Arayama City Arc: Chapter 15 The standoff had been broken. The burly commander stood about a hundred paces off, observing the battle personally and executing several deserters. These deeds had the remarkable effect of calming the Arahara Army and steadying their formation. No one dared speak of the assassination of their lord now. "What are you afraid of? That little brat doesn't even come up to a Lavender Melon's height. Get her!" The troops looked at each other until forced by their commander's enraged roar to charge at Riko. Riko heard it, of course. The hand that wielded her sword trembled, and Onigiri, hidden within her hood, mewled softly in fear. Well, I'm sorry that we oni lived on a deserted island and didn't get an opportunity to grow tall, and thus aren't fit to be your opponents. But a "fit" has got nothing to do with my ability to defeat you. Spinning on one tipped toe, Riko let fly her blade with a transient flash of crimson red. Light arced across the battlefield, piercing through the commander's torso. "Kissaki Yousen." This was the same special sword technique that the wandering spirit of the previous lord of the city had imparted to Riko — a fatal blade that utterly ignored all distances in battle. With a terrible, clean crack, the enemy commander's sword split in two, and he fell forward with an inaudible murmur, dead. Seeing their general go down, the Arahara Army stopped dead in its tracks. Not a single soldier dared to go a step further. Indeed, their formation fell into chaos swiftly thereafter, melting away utterly. Thus did Arayama City fall, and thus did the people who had long been oppressed rise up and take the lord's mansion, seizing back all that had once belonged to them. Yet through all this, Kataba Shintetsu did not show her face. Sheathing her sword, Riko realized that something was off, glancing upward towards the distant mountain peak. There stood Shintetsu upon Arayama City's greatest height, atop its blazing tower, watching the whole battle. Her face was shrouded in shadow, her expression unreadable. The two women locked gazes for an instant, and then with a leap, Shintetsu was gone. Kataba Shintetsu... Why had she come here? She had accepted the invitation of the lord of this city, only to turn around and assassinate him... Did she still have some good left in her? Riko shook her head. Now was not the time for excess thoughts. Comforting Onigiri, she quickly ran towards Arayama City. If she did not continue her pursuit in all haste, Shintetsu was sure to leave her far behind. ... Ryuutetsu Cage Arc: Chapter 1 She had gotten careless. This encampment was nothing but a well-disguised trap. Kataba Shintetsu had intentionally exposed her tracks, placing a large number of talismans amidst the camp, luring Yutaka Riko to pursue her. The moment Riko stepped into the camp, the talismans blew the mountainside clean away, and losing her footing, Riko plummeted into the chasm below... The impact of the fall was not an issue, but Ryuutetsu Cage, which lay below in the depths of the mountain, was the greatest threat. This chasm was once a pass separating two nations, and it was the site of a monstrous battle in which nearly a million people were slain. After the war ended, the two nations both sealed this area, pouring their destroyed weapons into this mountain rift. The souls of the unjustly slain warriors were trapped within the bloodied, broken metal, and as the shattered metal churned and turned, it would slowly evolve into the flowing metal sands seen today. There was no clear distinction between solid ground and the metal dunes, and one could step out onto the sand and immediately sink into the mire, unable to escape as the churning metal sands had swallowed and ground one into dust. One wrong step, and there would be no going back. This strange iron sand even spread across the stone walls, making even the idea of escape by climbing out laughable in the extreme. Only by slowly traversing the path at the bottom of the chasm could one have any hope of escape. But it was clear that no one had ever managed it. Those who fell into this cage may as well have been sentenced to death. But Riko was like a woman unburdened. Here was undeniable proof that Kataba Shintetsu had long forsaken any mercy or goodness. Now, when she lifted her sword against her, Riko would not have to hesitate. Not only this, but Shintetsu had underestimated the progress that Riko had made. This prison of metal sand would not hold her, for she had previously mastered the powerful ability named "Reppuu Tenshoku," which now came in handy. But just as Riko was about to use that technique, she spied two small heads peeping around the corner of a rock face. They were girls dressed in rags, their eyes gleaming with hope. "Are you from the outside world?" Riko nodded, retrieving Onigiri from her hood. It gave the two girls a limp greeting. The two girls took Riko to a mountain cave, and there she met their elders — a miserable group they were, having wound up in Ryuutetsu Cage by mistake. "We've been stuck here for several months now. We've barely managed to get by on the grains on our cart, spring water, moss and wild vegetables..." They were nine people and one cat. She had just enough strength to carry them all out on the woven wings of a gale. Thus, she made this offer: "How would you like to escape together with me?" The old man who led the party kept his eyes on Riko's pale red horn, hesitation in his eyes. "Warrior... If my eyes do not deceive me, you must be of oni descent, right?" Unease flashed across Riko's heart. "That's right, I am an oni. Is there a problem?" ... Ryuutetsu Cage Arc: Chapter 14 Onigiri's tail, like a compass' needle, quivered for a moment before pointing forward and to the right. Yutaka Riko stepped forward tentatively — onto solid rock. Good! The chasm's exit was close at hand now. If she followed her present speed, she and Onigiri would escape Ryuutetsu Cage before dawn the next day. "Well done, Onigiri." Riko had never known till this day that Onigiri's spirit-sight could not only find wandering spirits that could help Riko master all manner of abilities but that it could also be used to steer clear of danger. The vengeful spirits of the Ryuutetsu Cage were unveiled in Onigiri's eyes as if in plain sight, allowing it to find a safe way through. Perhaps this was the work of the magatama within Onigiri... Were her tribespeople watching over her? Even so, close to freedom and escape, Riko could not be pleased. The words of those people buzzed in her ears, agitating and irritating her. "Even if we starve here, I'll never trust an oni!" What was with that? She was an oni, sure, but so what? Everyone was kind, and they had lived peacefully and kept to themselves on their island. Why were they seen as the enemy? Yet the gazes of those two children were too innocent, and Riko would not leave them to their fate. So she had left all her dry rations with them before using "Kagamichuu Shubutsu" to copy them several times, thus ensuring that they would have enough food to last another half a month. She had memorized the entire route that she had taken as well. Once they departed, she would look for a nearby garrison and mark the safe route out for them. This way, the garrison would be able to rescue the trapped people. Ah, this was so exhausting — worse than any battle she had experienced before. Riko's eyes were dull as she petted Onigiri idly. Sometimes, all we need is a scapegoat to pin our negativity on in order to bounce back. As a hazy figure materialized before Riko's eyes, she muttered, irrepressible resentment in her voice, "This is all your fault, Kataba Shintetsu..." "Next time, I won't let you escape." ...

tale comes from the desolate, distant past. In those days, the mountains' teeth were still bared like blades against man and beast, thirsting for the souls of the feeble-minded, human and nonhuman alike. People knew that the god of the mountains loved them not, and was to be given a wide berth. Yet they were forced to seek shelter in caverns from the storms screaming through the wilds, all to pass one long night after the next. But these caverns, like the mountains, extracted payment from these vagrants. Countless were the tribes who lost kin to the wastes through which they stumbled blind. Valiant Tequil and his kindhearted brother Rimac were born to one such tribe. At the hour of their birth, a long, troubling night reigned inside and outside the caves, and though the campfires around which the tribespeople sat flickered, none were comforted by their light. The people thought: "This fire shall soon go out, and once it does, we too shall be finished!" "How long will this night last? I'm cold... and hungry too..." "Let's hurry things up then! Quickly, let me walk into the night! Better that than this torment." "Oh, you poor children... You poor, poor children..." Yet Tequil and Rimac did not announce themselves with sorrowful cries as other children did. Instead, Tequil stared into the cavern depths. The minions of the cavern did their best to frighten him, but his gaze swept over them, keen as a sharp stone spur. "He has seen us, our sharp claws and long teeth, but he is not afraid!" The wicked creatures whispered amongst themselves anxiously, and involuntarily retracted said appendages. Rimac for his part waved his hands and laughed, and his laughter was like pebbles tumbling in a stream, drawing the eyes of all the distressed tribespeople to his face. Only then did they notice that though the flame wavered, it had never ceased to burn, and with another wave of his hands, Rimac patted the firewood next to him. "Feed the flame! Feed the flame!" The elderly chief, thus reminded by the newborn boy, shouted his words aloud, repelling the fear that had been about to swallow the tribe whole. People stood and fueled the fire, and they drew their obsidian blades, casting their eyes into the cavern depths just as Tequil had. The beasts of the cavern were filled with rage and hate, but they knew that these people would not loosen their grip on their weapons, nor would their eyes be shut. Terror had already fled, and so death was forced to retreat. Only when the sun rose again did the brothers close their eyes, falling asleep in their mother's bosom. Thus did the tribespeople depart the cave, having lived another day. These people, who had rejected fear, would live countless days more. Yet the defeat of her evil underlings caught the eye of their master, Coatlicue. For this lord of demons, who claimed to be the mother of the underworld and mistress of ten thousand times ten thousand caves, whose fangs were the rocky stalactites, whose tongue was every blast of wet, frigid wind, and who upon awakening could only be satiated by devouring ten thousand living souls — Tequil and Rimac were the first humans to slip her grasp. Shamefaced, this earth mother waved her hand, lashing the evil beasts cowering to the side with rock. "Go! Go! Redeem your humiliating failure! Capture those dimwitted mortals and fill my stomach!" But having seen their fears vanquished, the people remembered well the methods of scattering those terrors time after time. They settled at the foot of the mountains, sharpened wooden stakes, lit fires, and gave the sharpest blades to their best warriors, with which they would stand guard behind the stakes. Their bright eyes pierced the wilderness beyond the firelight, and did not shift their gazes away for even a moment. By blade and fire did Coatlicue's minions taste defeat time after time, until they could do nothing but huddle in the dark, daring not to draw near the flame. The fires in the hearts of the people ignited, and they began to speak of victory, of light, and of the end of the viper — they believed in Tequil and Rimac. These two brothers could surely keep the heat and light alive. Tequil and Rimac thought the same, and so they sharpened their spears and blades, preparing to drive the demon lord of that evil serpent to her doom. But the earth mother, who hated this tribe, did not relent. She took sludge from the deepest parts of the cave and pinched it into a snake. Then, she plucked out her eye, setting it into the serpent's eye socket. "It was that child who caused you to witness the fire, and so, let me go and swallow his eyes." One evening, when the sun had just set, night's veil was slowly covering the sky, and the stars had yet to begin granting their light, the serpent bit and slew a rabbit beyond the tribe's bounds, and burrowed into its skin, lying flat on the ground. Rimac, returning from gathering herbs, came upon this rabbit, and seeing its wound, the kind child put his torch down without hesitation, and reaching for his herbs, he chewed on them, preparing to apply them to the rabbit. But the snake, speaking for the earth mother, leaped from the wound, hissing laughter: "Hahaha, ignorant, foolish human! Sacrificing yourself for a lowly rabbit!" Before Rimac could retrieve his torch, the earth mother's serpent latched its fangs first onto his neck, then, burrowing into his body, captured his heart and soul both. The defenseless sentries were the next to be murdered by the earth mother, for they greeted Rimac just as they always did when he returned from gathering herbs, only to be pierced through the heart by the serpent, dying on the spot. The entire tribe's fires were put out, and amidst the shroud of darkness, death and terror were resurgent. The earth mother spat the snake out, and through poisoned fangs she cried out: "Behold! Behold, you arrogant fools, and kneel as you should in the dust!" But the sound of a rock being struck cut her off, for Tequil, who had been sharpening his obsidian blade, used it to create sparks that set his tent alight. He raised his blade and charged forward, letting fly his blade at the earth mother's messenger. The blazing edge cleaved the poisoned serpent molded from soil with ease, but as Tequil was about to follow through, he saw his brother's eyes and the blood staining his brother's hands. That instant was all the time the wounded viper needed to escape. Yet nigh fully charred it was still, and the earth mother's eye reduced almost to ashes. This tribe was destroyed, and never again was there a chance it would dare defy her. Thus did the earth mother comfort herself as she retreated into the darkness. How Tequil wished to call out Rimac's name! But the burning dust caught in his throat, and so he could only watch as his brother vanished into the night. When the night at last passed, Tequil, who stood amidst the ruins, knew that the surviving tribespeople could no longer stay. Burying his confusion and pain deep in his heart, he led them on a new journey. They crossed mountains and canyons, dodging fearsome beasts and poisonous insects. Tequil did not close his eyes for so long as they journeyed, nor did he dare to loosen his grip on blade or torch. Finally, by a silent volcano, they found a tribe willing to take them in. Only after he saw the last of his tribe peacefully fall into slumber under the old shaman's care did he relax and collapse to the earth. When he awoke, he found himself in a blazing cave. The lava that surrounded him undulated with an erratic pulse, as if the very mountain was slowly breathing. When he stood up, the lava boiled and bubbled, and a rumbling came from all directions: "Do not search for your brother. His eyes have been devoured by a cunning serpent." "But I must save him, and pursue that venomous snake also!" His words echoed through the cave, but the Goddess of Mountains and Fire was silent. Tequil thus prayed unto her: "Let my brother's name live on. I am willing to sacrifice my heart and blood in return." The goddess answered him in the echoing cave. Thus said she: "Your prayer have I heard, but your brother is no longer your kin. His name has sunken into the deepest of depths." Tequil raised his head and lifted up his wish to the goddess: "Turn my blood to fire, so my heart may illuminate the depths. I will bring my brother back before my blood runs dry." "Turn my blood to fire, until my soul may sear and slay that serpent. I will take its head before my blood runs dry." When Tequil awoke once again, the old shaman of the tribe gave him a brand-new sword, food, and water. Finally, the shaman clasped his shoulders and blessed him: "May your fire dry the venomous snake's venom." Thus did Tequil embark on another journey. His strength was endless, his body tireless, and his blood burned like lava. He crossed grassy fields and snowy peaks, deep valleys and high mountains, and the Goddess of Mountains and Fire showed him the way with falling rocks and the cracks in cliffs. Thus did Tequil stride forward without hesitation. When he met his brother again, the earth mother mocked him once more using Rimac's body and voice, but when her claws pierced Tequil's chest, he moved not, and instead her bones were melted by his burning blood. Tequil stared the vicious demon lord down, and said in a loud voice: "My brother is gentle of heart. He would surely have made this land a better place." "Yet you have affronted him with your poison, smothered his virtue, slaughtered those who had faith in his virtue!" "Die, you despicable, venomous insect! Die here!" As he roared, Tequil's blood stained his obsidian blade, turning it red-hot in an instant. The earth mother watched in terror as her shell, bones, and soul were sundered. She wished to scream, to buy but a moment in which she could unleash her claws and tear Tequil to ribbons. But she could make no sound, for in the fire's light, the Goddess of Mountains and Fire opened one eye, causing a silent soul to whom this body once belonged to awaken and grasp the snake by the neck. The goddess cried out: "You vile snake, you wicked shade, be driven out by the light, as you should!" The blazing flames swept over every corner in that gloomy, frigid cavern, and every last poisonous insect within was slain, burned to ash alongside every plot and scheme, so heinous and vile. As the last drop of his blood was about to burn away, the roof of the hole above Tequil's head trembled. A fissure opened, and a gem fell down and stopped up his wound. The falling rocks, too, formed a body for the soul that had been bitten by the serpent. The Goddess of Mountains and Fire spoke once more, and her voice echoed across the walls: "I have seen your heart and blood, and I shall give of my own. Go back now, return to your tribe with your brother." "Yet this heart and blood shall not be left for you, but rather, for justice and fairness, for the good and the brave." One night, the old shaman who had waited day after day beyond the tribe's bounds stood to welcome the returning Tequil and his brother Rimac. They took the offered water and food, and said: "The venomous snake is slain, and we are victorious." "But our hearts and blood do not remain for us, but rather, for justice and fairness, for the good and the brave." "Light the fire. Together we shall stand, and ensure that the flame is never extinguished."

tale comes from the desolate, distant past. In those days, the mountains' teeth were still bared like blades against man and beast, thirsting for the souls of the feeble-minded, human and nonhuman alike. People knew that the god of the mountains loved them not, and was to be given a wide berth. Yet they were forced to seek shelter in caverns from the storms screaming through the wilds, all to pass one long night after the next. But these caverns, like the mountains, extracted payment from these vagrants. Countless were the tribes who lost kin to the wastes through which they stumbled blind. Valiant Tequil and his kindhearted brother Rimac were born to one such tribe. At the hour of their birth, a long, troubling night reigned inside and outside the caves, and though the campfires around which the tribespeople sat flickered, none were comforted by their light. The people thought: "This fire shall soon go out, and once it does, we too shall be finished!" "How long will this night last? I'm cold... and hungry too..." "Let's hurry things up then! Quickly, let me walk into the night! Better that than this torment." "Oh, you poor children... You poor, poor children..." Yet Tequil and Rimac did not announce themselves with sorrowful cries as other children did. Instead, Tequil stared into the cavern depths. The minions of the cavern did their best to frighten him, but his gaze swept over them, keen as a sharp stone spur. "He has seen us, our sharp claws and long teeth, but he is not afraid!" The wicked creatures whispered amongst themselves anxiously, and involuntarily retracted said appendages. Rimac for his part waved his hands and laughed, and his laughter was like pebbles tumbling in a stream, drawing the eyes of all the distressed tribespeople to his face. Only then did they notice that though the flame wavered, it had never ceased to burn, and with another wave of his hands, Rimac patted the firewood next to him. "Feed the flame! Feed the flame!" The elderly chief, thus reminded by the newborn boy, shouted his words aloud, repelling the fear that had been about to swallow the tribe whole. People stood and fueled the fire, and they drew their obsidian blades, casting their eyes into the cavern depths just as Tequil had. The beasts of the cavern were filled with rage and hate, but they knew that these people would not loosen their grip on their weapons, nor would their eyes be shut. Terror had already fled, and so death was forced to retreat. Only when the sun rose again did the brothers close their eyes, falling asleep in their mother's bosom. Thus did the tribespeople depart the cave, having lived another day. These people, who had rejected fear, would live countless days more. Yet the defeat of her evil underlings caught the eye of their master, Coatlicue. For this lord of demons, who claimed to be the mother of the underworld and mistress of ten thousand times ten thousand caves, whose fangs were the rocky stalactites, whose tongue was every blast of wet, frigid wind, and who upon awakening could only be satiated by devouring ten thousand living souls — Tequil and Rimac were the first humans to slip her grasp. Shamefaced, this earth mother waved her hand, lashing the evil beasts cowering to the side with rock. "Go! Go! Redeem your humiliating failure! Capture those dimwitted mortals and fill my stomach!" But having seen their fears vanquished, the people remembered well the methods of scattering those terrors time after time. They settled at the foot of the mountains, sharpened wooden stakes, lit fires, and gave the sharpest blades to their best warriors, with which they would stand guard behind the stakes. Their bright eyes pierced the wilderness beyond the firelight, and did not shift their gazes away for even a moment. By blade and fire did Coatlicue's minions taste defeat time after time, until they could do nothing but huddle in the dark, daring not to draw near the flame. The fires in the hearts of the people ignited, and they began to speak of victory, of light, and of the end of the viper — they believed in Tequil and Rimac. These two brothers could surely keep the heat and light alive. Tequil and Rimac thought the same, and so they sharpened their spears and blades, preparing to drive the demon lord of that evil serpent to her doom. But the earth mother, who hated this tribe, did not relent. She took sludge from the deepest parts of the cave and pinched it into a snake. Then, she plucked out her eye, setting it into the serpent's eye socket. "It was that child who caused you to witness the fire, and so, let me go and swallow his eyes." One evening, when the sun had just set, night's veil was slowly covering the sky, and the stars had yet to begin granting their light, the serpent bit and slew a rabbit beyond the tribe's bounds, and burrowed into its skin, lying flat on the ground. Rimac, returning from gathering herbs, came upon this rabbit, and seeing its wound, the kind child put his torch down without hesitation, and reaching for his herbs, he chewed on them, preparing to apply them to the rabbit. But the snake, speaking for the earth mother, leaped from the wound, hissing laughter: "Hahaha, ignorant, foolish human! Sacrificing yourself for a lowly rabbit!" Before Rimac could retrieve his torch, the earth mother's serpent latched its fangs first onto his neck, then, burrowing into his body, captured his heart and soul both. The defenseless sentries were the next to be murdered by the earth mother, for they greeted Rimac just as they always did when he returned from gathering herbs, only to be pierced through the heart by the serpent, dying on the spot. The entire tribe's fires were put out, and amidst the shroud of darkness, death and terror were resurgent. The earth mother spat the snake out, and through poisoned fangs she cried out: "Behold! Behold, you arrogant fools, and kneel as you should in the dust!" But the sound of a rock being struck cut her off, for Tequil, who had been sharpening his obsidian blade, used it to create sparks that set his tent alight. He raised his blade and charged forward, letting fly his blade at the earth mother's messenger. The blazing edge cleaved the poisoned serpent molded from soil with ease, but as Tequil was about to follow through, he saw his brother's eyes and the blood staining his brother's hands. That instant was all the time the wounded viper needed to escape. Yet nigh fully charred it was still, and the earth mother's eye reduced almost to ashes. This tribe was destroyed, and never again was there a chance it would dare defy her. Thus did the earth mother comfort herself as she retreated into the darkness. How Tequil wished to call out Rimac's name! But the burning dust caught in his throat, and so he could only watch as his brother vanished into the night. When the night at last passed, Tequil, who stood amidst the ruins, knew that the surviving tribespeople could no longer stay. Burying his confusion and pain deep in his heart, he led them on a new journey. They crossed mountains and canyons, dodging fearsome beasts and poisonous insects. Tequil did not close his eyes for so long as they journeyed, nor did he dare to loosen his grip on blade or torch. Finally, by a silent volcano, they found a tribe willing to take them in. Only after he saw the last of his tribe peacefully fall into slumber under the old shaman's care did he relax and collapse to the earth. When he awoke, he found himself in a blazing cave. The lava that surrounded him undulated with an erratic pulse, as if the very mountain was slowly breathing. When he stood up, the lava boiled and bubbled, and a rumbling came from all directions: "Do not search for your brother. His eyes have been devoured by a cunning serpent." "But I must save him, and pursue that venomous snake also!" His words echoed through the cave, but the Goddess of Mountains and Fire was silent. Tequil thus prayed unto her: "Let my brother's name live on. I am willing to sacrifice my heart and blood in return." The goddess answered him in the echoing cave. Thus said she: "Your prayer have I heard, but your brother is no longer your kin. His name has sunken into the deepest of depths." Tequil raised his head and lifted up his wish to the goddess: "Turn my blood to fire, so my heart may illuminate the depths. I will bring my brother back before my blood runs dry." "Turn my blood to fire, until my soul may sear and slay that serpent. I will take its head before my blood runs dry." When Tequil awoke once again, the old shaman of the tribe gave him a brand-new sword, food, and water. Finally, the shaman clasped his shoulders and blessed him: "May your fire dry the venomous snake's venom." Thus did Tequil embark on another journey. His strength was endless, his body tireless, and his blood burned like lava. He crossed grassy fields and snowy peaks, deep valleys and high mountains, and the Goddess of Mountains and Fire showed him the way with falling rocks and the cracks in cliffs. Thus did Tequil stride forward without hesitation. When he met his brother again, the earth mother mocked him once more using Rimac's body and voice, but when her claws pierced Tequil's chest, he moved not, and instead her bones were melted by his burning blood. Tequil stared the vicious demon lord down, and said in a loud voice: "My brother is gentle of heart. He would surely have made this land a better place." "Yet you have affronted him with your poison, smothered his virtue, slaughtered those who had faith in his virtue!" "Die, you despicable, venomous insect! Die here!" As he roared, Tequil's blood stained his obsidian blade, turning it red-hot in an instant. The earth mother watched in terror as her shell, bones, and soul were sundered. She wished to scream, to buy but a moment in which she could unleash her claws and tear Tequil to ribbons. But she could make no sound, for in the fire's light, the silent soul to whom this body once belonged awakened. And that soul cried out to his brother: "I do not wish to see your blood be reduced to ash, but I have seen the light of your heart and spirit. Remember my name, brother. As long as you remember me, I will never have left." The blazing flames swept over every corner in that gloomy, frigid cavern, and every last poisonous insect within was slain, burned to ash alongside every plot and scheme, so heinous and vile. As the last drop of his blood was about to burn away, the roof of the cave above Tequil's head trembled. A fissure opened, and a gem fell down and stopped up his wound. The Goddess of Mountains and Fire spoke once more, and her voice echoed across the walls: "You yet have one drop of blood. Return to your tribe, for this is your brother's wish, and I will see it fulfilled." One night, the old shaman who had waited day after day beyond the tribe's bounds stood to welcome the returning Tequil. But Tequil refused the water, the food, and the cheers. Instead, he simply said: "The venomous snake is slain, and I am victorious. But I shall soon depart along with my brother." He took the gem from his chest, placed it upon a torch, and walked up to the silent volcano. "I have but one drop of blood left, but it was not left for me, but rather, for justice and fairness, for the good and the brave." "Use it, and light a fire — a flame that shall never be extinguished." Having said that, valiant Tequil leaped into the dead volcano. The earth was shaken by his heart and blood, and the volcano's own heart resumed beating, the blazing lava once more beginning to flow. The volcano lives — as does the bravery of all the tribes.

book about a young woman named Lycia who sets out on a journey alone following the ruination of her homeland at the hands of a black dragon. ... On her journey, she met a former guard of the kingdom, now an errant wanderer, and sought his guidance in the art of swordsmanship. But the guard had long since given up hope, and had lost both the will to wield a sword and the courage to swing it. "I cannot fill a bottle with 'hope' and give it to you," said Lycia. "But I do remember a song from my childhood. It sings of how spring is as fleeting as a shooting star, and it taught me to cherish every flower still in blossom about my feet." "You need not master the way of the sword," said the guard. "I can see in your eyes that you are already in possession of something even more powerful." ... After continuing on her way once more, following the guidance of the elders, Lycia entered a dense forest and came before a wise owl, keeper of the keys to the Kingdom of Dreams. The owl's laughter, rolling forth like a shrouding mist, enveloped her from all sides. "Do you know what it means to retreat in the face of adversity?" "As long as my legs can still walk, I will keep moving forward." "Do you fear the thought of death knocking at your door?" "I will fight it, right up until the final moment arrives." "One last question... Can you swear to set your heart on revenge?" "I—" ... Having now obtained the key, Lycia opened the door to the Kingdom of Dreams, where she was to cross a river of stars and ascend an ink-black stairway, enduring many hardships. Finally, she confessed the reason for her coming before the goddess of dreams, and, in exchange for a lock of her golden hair, learned the magic of luring someone into a dream. Then, she declared that she would take revenge upon the black dragon. In the beginning, the black dragon knew only black and white; but under the magic's spell, it dreamed of a thousand and one different worlds, each far more vibrant and vivid than fire and brimstone. "If worlds like these strike your fancy as well," said Lycia, "I will turn back the dial of the night sky, reversing all the stars in their courses, returning things to the day before you arrived in my hometown." ... At the story's end, Lycia awoke from the previous night's dream to the familiar sights of her hometown outside the window. The birds were singing and the flowers in bloom, and all was at peace. From the little door of the wooden cabin, there came a gentle knocking. Opening the door, Lycia beheld a black-haired stranger standing outside. "I cannot distinguish the color of your hair," the man said. "But I suppose it must be golden, just like the color of the stars in my dream." ...

to my heir and granddaughter, Ella . In our family 's history, she will most likely be the most eccentric but cutest Ella Musk. This handy handbook can only offer some basic assistance in situations where you urgently need to communicate in Hilichurlian (this book is for reference only and cannot be held responsible for any consequences of its use). If you wish to learn Hilichurlian, please use a standard textbook such as my next introductory book. Greetings, Etiquette: "Da/Dada" 1. Good/Very good. 2. Casual affirmation when conversing, such as, "Ah, okay." 3. Very, completely, most. Note: " Dada upa " means "very tall/large mountain." "Ika ya/Ika yaya/Ya ika/Yaya ika" 1. A bad person/Bad people! Note: If you hear hilichurls shout these words and you are confident in yourself, give them a wallop. Otherwise, run. "Muhe" 1. Like, want. Note: You will not generally hear hilichurls say that they like you, so translating this as "want" is sufficient. Useful Phrases: "Gusha" 1. Vegetables, grasses, fruits. Disliked things. Note: Aside from eating plants, "mosi gusha" can also express unhappiness. If a hilichurl says "Gusha" to you, you must use their tone of voice to determine if they want fruits, rice, or wheat, or if they are dissatisfied. "Mita" 1. Meat, delicious foods. Liked items. Note: "In movo lata mita / Mita in movo lata / Mita movo lata" refers to "meat in the water" — I believe that even you can figure that one out, little Ella. "Upano" 1. Difficult to explain, please see note. Note: This word is affixed to nouns and describes an upper direction, height, or flight. It can indicate flying insects, birds, clouds, patrolling knights, a small companion sent flying by a larger hilichurl. In short, this word is difficult to explain. "Celi" 1. Hot. Something that is hot. Fire. 2. Occasionally "sun"; "Celi upa" without "upa" can also mean "sun." Note: "Celi lata" is an unusual figure of speech as it implies both cold and heat. This phrase generally refers to things that emit light but not heat. For example, "Celi lata gusha" is " Small Lamp Grass ," And "Celi lata" can describe things such as fireflies, stars, or the moon. "Kucha gusha/Unu gusha" 1. Seed. Note: It may be hard to believe that I would list such a word. Hilichurls do not specifically practice farming, but they have a habit of stockpiling seeds. Sometimes when they are in a good mood, they will find a place and bury their seeds. "Kucha" means "small," and carries a slightly contemptuous connotation in Hilichurlian. "Unu" is the number "one" and is a holy word that embodies the hilichurls' concept of gods and the origin of life. Both of these terms can be used to describe a seed, which is fascinating. By the way, "Du" is two, "Unu du" is three, and "Dudu" is four. Can you guess what five is? The correct answer is "Mani," which also means "hands" or "physical labor." "Sada" 1. Solid, hard. Note: In Hilichurlian, "Upa sada" means that you are prepared to do something. "Boya" 1. Used with certain words to denote colors. Note: According to my tests, "Celi boya" is red, "Gusha boya" is green," "Lata boya" is blue, "Nini boya" is white, "Nunu boya/Sama boya" are black, and "Unu boya" is yellow. Time and Directions: "Aba mosi dada" 1. From waking until lunch. "Unta mosi dada" 1. The wonderful time from lunch till just before sunset. "Mosi aba nunu" 1. From after sunset until late night. "Unta nunu" 1. Late night. "Du ya zido dala?" 1. Where did this thing go? Note: After some thought, I have decided to omit Hilichurlian directional words from this handbook. Hilichurls do not have absolute directions, so their directional speech is relative. However, the subject in their responses depends on their attitude towards you. If they like you, they will speak from your point if view. If not, they will use themselves as the frame of reference. The most recommended method is to obtain a map, ask them this question, and have them identify the location on the map.O Nagarjuna , Aided by Khvarena in its countless forms, I bless this land of eternal calamity. When the sludge of the deepest depths of the abyss stained the first kingdom, The glorious Khvarena that aided the Lord of Wisdom was scattered in endless forms. I crossed back over the River of Sorrow, and of the Amrita I drank. I opened a path for the benevolent spirits so that the merciful light of wisdom may illuminate the four corners. O Nagarjuna, Aided by Khvarena in its countless forms, I nourish the benevolent spirits in the sea of flowers. Behold, soul illuminated by Khvarena, final descendant of the god of grass and trees. Behold, heroes who battle the cataclysm endlessly, foes of the Dev. For not even the inky gloom from beyond the skies shall erode their forms. O Nagarjuna, Aided by Khvarena in its countless forms, I have transcended the dead of this foul earth. Cleanse the sinless of their sins, so that they may be reborn in a pure land free of suffering. In the chakras of the earth are contained the karmic seeds that will give birth to all things. The fleeting blights and glories of the earthly realm are naught but the illusion of existing seeds. O Nagarjuna, Aided by Khvarena in its countless forms, I have cleansed the abyss of heaven above. The sludge welling up from the depths of the abyss has finally receded, The legacy of Dahri , too, has submitted to the law. A thousand songs were sung in unison, and the heavy rains abated for a time. O Nagarjuna, If the dark tide reappears and the black abyss returns, Sing this hymn and offer prayers to the Khvarena unassailable. May the eternal Khvarena guide us on the upward path.

to the desert dwellers, the world was once ruled by a king named Al-Ahmar , a king of warriors, horticulturists, and sages. He controlled the winds whistling through the desert, the dunes turned bright silver by moonlight, and the one thousand and one Jinn who hid within the night and the calls of owls. They say that Al-Ahmar was a son of the sky. That is why he was known as the king of the world and received the fervent faith of countless people from the three great tribes, and was even adored by the elusive Jinn. Whenever he looked up to the sky and recalled the boundless paradise high above, and the merciless reign of thousands of years past, Al-Ahmar could not help but lower his noble head and sigh helplessly. In such moments, even the songs of the nightingale and the aroma of roses could not pull him from his sorrow. The desert dwellers knew well that the ravings of nostalgia often presaged the arrival of calamity. But in that world where the wise enjoyed peace and happiness, and in the era where brave young men and women courted like lions and roses, no one foresaw the arrival of catastrophe. But how should we blame the people and spirits of the past? Even one as wise as the greatest of sages, Hermanubis , could never have known that the valiant tribe that once could equal the dragons would be reduced to corpse-eating monsters a thousand years later, and that their sullied honor and bones would be buried for eternity beneath the gilded dunes. How could he have known that the tribe of the wise, known for generations of sages, would lose our texts and become wandering bards of the desert, mourning our emperor with songs that only the Jinn understand? It is as the sages say: a mere thought can yet often bring forth calamity, if it is from the undisguised melancholy and madness of a king. Thus did the three retainers of Al-Ahmar (may seven times seven curses fall upon them!) present their strategy to the king: "Your Majesty, ruler of the world, lord of the four corners of the earth, king over Jinn and mortals alike." The Goat King, the minister of all ministers, spoke flatteringly, "I humbly beg your pardon if I overstep, but Your Majesty, I'm certain you are aware that indulging in dreams of old and sorrows of the past is no way to be for long. The endless power and wisdom of this land can build you a palace that surpasses the heavens, Your Majesty, and it shall bring your people a prosperous future." "No," Al-Ahmar said with a frown, and the Goat King fell silent. "Your Majesty, son of the sky, subjugator of gods, and greatest of all sages," The Ibis King, the scribe of all scribes, advised, "The divine punishment of a thousand years past brought the downfall of wisdom and history. For a better future, Your Majesty, you should take control of the past. The present oases hold the wisdom of the 'present', but if we are to seize the 'past', we must act swiftly." "No." Al-Ahmar struck the ground with his staff, and the Ibis King fell silent. "Your Majesty, lord of dunes and oases, guide of the living and the dead, master of all elements." The Crocodile King, the commander of commanders, spoke frankly, "If we are to recall the lost lives and welcome lost opportunities and dreams back into the fold, then this is our final chance. The greater the authority, the greater the emptiness. The greater the wisdom, the greater the sorrow. Forget the delusions of the Void. Only resurrection and life eternal can fill the endless pit of regret." Al-Ahmar fell silent. "Fine." The arbitrary king heeded his retainers ' lies. Thus did Al-Ahmar use a hundred years and a hundred years further to build a huge maze for his kingdom, before trapping himself deep within it in search of forbidden knowledge and an elixir with which he might abandon his mortal form. The subsequent events are knowledge that should not be revisited. They should be eternally forgotten by any rational history. According to the legends of the desert dwellers, in just one night, the kingdom of wisdom and power was buried by the sands of retribution. They say Al-Ahmar separated his mind from his flesh and bone, placing it within the corridors, stairways, doorways, and beams that crawled eternally into the depths. It is said that Al-Ahmar's body gradually decayed on his throne while worms feasted on it, and that his soul merged into one with the wailing souls of the millions in his kingdom, doomed to wander, lost amidst the howling end, traveling along the dark and winding corridors, growing ever closer to the bottomless abyss... Thus did the minds of millions merge into one, a lone soul that would eventually succumb to madness. And so, Al-Ahmar's kingdom was built and destroyed by his own hand. They say that when that night came, the desert quaked, and the walls of Al-Ahmar's royal city collapsed. One thousand and one pillars trembled before the gale, and the bulls and griffins that once stood proudly atop them, gazing down at the lifeless dunes, now reluctantly fell into its gilded embrace. Countless people, sage or fool, hero or coward — all of them vanished within the sandstorm that night. The lucky survivors fell into eternal silence. It's said that they were made blind and mute as punishment for their sin of benefitting from forbidden knowledge.The sages say that trying to keep knowledge for yourself is ignorance, and that the punishment for ignorance is ignorance itself. As for the descendants of the ignorant who have lost their history, the Eremites say: We have returned from the land of the lost, The sky of the ages we have changed, Fear shall not stop us, No god shall we heed. Across the ocean of sand akin to gravel, To its end we shall sail.

has it that King Al-Ahmar , while still alive, had collected numerous Jinn and demons from across the world, placing them within magic bottles. Legend has it that the world was once teeming with such Jinn. Al-Ahmar, mighty yet bewildered, seized them from the silver night winds and quicksands of the desert, the mystical swirls of the ocean, and the tinkling springs in the rainforest, and kept them in silver bottles. He was like an arrogant conqueror, and at the same time, a curious child. Al-Ahmar harnessed the spirits with bridles and yokes, learned from their laments about the story of the dismal moon and the driving morning star, and built the majestic Ay-Khanoum — the "City of Amphitheaters," or "City of the Moon Maiden" — to commemorate them. It is said to have been the city of the spirits, the paradise for migrants from the moon, gifted to them by Al-Ahmar. In return, the spirits constructed the huge doorway to his mausoleum. This is the tale as the desert singers would tell it. Countless years later, Ay-Khanoum — like Saleh , the city of the valiant Thamudians, Tulaytullah , the land of the wise Tighnarians , and Orghana , the city of the Twenty-Nine Deys — has long been buried beneath heavy sands and swirling currents, as have the countless clans that inhabited it and the innumerable Jinn imprisoned in their silver magic bottles. But now, let us leave the unnecessary fact-finding to one side and return to the subject... Fifteen years after Port Ormos was built, a young shepherd found a silver bottle in the Gravelsong Dunes (Note 1). Whether out of childish curiosity or a recklessness uncharacteristic of desert dwellers, the boy broke the seal beneath the silver bottle and opened it beneath the moonlight. (Note 2) "The ravens of the mortal world are so exceptionally noisy..." A Jinni arose from within the bottle (Note 3) in the form of a dancer, as flexible and languid as a cat and as bright and beautiful as a water lily. "Ravens...?" The youth was clueless, as he did not resemble a bird, nor was he noisy. "Yes, ravens." The spirit repeated, rather impatiently. "Birds that live fast and die fast, a noisy lot and no mistake... 'Only when they die do they wake up.' What about this is there to not understand, hmm?" The young man shook his head in confusion, bringing a sigh to the spirit's lips. "Listen, foolish bird." The spirit shook her head, her myrrh-scented braids swaying gently in the moonlight, the golden bells dangling at their ends ringing dreamily, but her amber eyes glinting like daggers. "I will allow you to ask three questions under three conditions..." "First, do not defame my lord Al-Ahmar. This is my bottom line. (Note 4)" "Second, harbor you no arrogance. Short-lived mortals should know where they stand." "Third, do not pry into the affairs of heaven and earth. Know this: there are indeed brave guardians and splendid stars in heaven." "If you fail to comply, I will fly into your mouth and nose on the night wind, like the three moon goddesses on their steeds, draw out your guts and soul, and make your lifeless flesh my new home." The youngster hastened to cover his mouth and nose, nodding profusely to show that he understood the conditions. "Then ask, beloved child of my lord, slave of heaven." Said the spirit, chuckling. The bright moonlight fell on her braids, and flowed into her nearly transparent skin, granting it a crystalline sheen. "Who are you?" The young man asked. "I'm a creation of the sky, yet also a creature of this world. I'm an exile of the ages, a faithful servant to my great lord. I'm an elemental spirit who will not bow to flesh and blood, an eternal prisoner content with the illusion of comfort..." The spirit held her head up high with pride, letting moonlight flow through her translucent body, her golden bells ringing in the desert wind. "As a descendant of Liloufar , I can be big or small. I can rise or hide. My kindred may be found in the waves, in the night wind, or in the pale light of the dead moon. In short, I'm a spirit, and I'm proud of who I am." "Then why are you in this bottle?" The young man shook the silver bottle in his hand and asked uncomprehendingly. "My lord Al-Ahmar aspired to conquer the world. All mountains and seas would be his to command. To this end, he made us magic bottles of silver and stamped his mark on us, and so we became his servants, engaging in noble deeds of creation and exploration. In other words... we were not servants in shame, but servants with pride." "But afterwards..." The spirit said quietly, her amber eyes darkening. "My lord brought disaster upon himself, leaving us sentenced to generations of oblivion. We were trapped in sealed silver bottles, drowning in dreams until the moment of our death." "Well, your third question, then!" The spirit waved her hand briskly, causing a clear jingle of the ancient silver coins adorning her wrists. "Have a care for your query, or your mouth and nose will suffer!" "So..." The young man hesitated for a moment, and asked the last question. "What's it like to live in a bottle?" Seemingly having never heard of such a question before, the spirit was slightly surprised before she answered slowly. "In the first era, I lived in a carefree palace, singing with nightingales and talking with roses. It was a beautiful time, a time when poets and lovers were born because of me. In those days, it seemed that the entire City of the Moon Maiden was in the bottle, and even the tasteless spring water was intoxicating." "At that time, I told myself that if anyone ever broke the seal and let me out into the outside world, I would curse and kill them." "In the era that came after, sandstorms and demons ran riot. Nightingales sang till their voice grew raspy and their blood dried up. Roses withered and turned into tangles of thorns. Poets died of maltreatment, lovers were displaced, prosperity vanished... It was a dreadful time when everything came to a standstill in the eternal collapse. Yet likewise, the City of the Moon Maiden seemed to be right in the bottle." "So I told myself that if anyone ever broke the seal and let me out into the outside world, I would fight against its injustice." "Then in the third era, everything was reduced to dust. The grand play of the City of the Moon Maiden came to an end, and what remained were the ruined theater and the wrecked masks of the gods. In that era, I ran out of tears to shed, and the chiming golden bells and the fluttering veil became to me a haunting curse." "And so, I told myself amidst that desolation that if anyone ever broke the seal and let me out into the outside world, I would turn into an evil seeking revenge — I would destroy the world, or else destroy myself." "So..." A gust of cold wind in the desert sent a shiver over the young man, causing him to tighten his loose robe. "Yes, I could have made you the first target of my revenge... tore your bones and flesh to make a cruel song of your soul." The spirit smiled teasingly, like a nightingale announcing a death on a summer night. "Yet the dead moon cast a glow over the quicksand dunes, and over me... and I suddenly realized how lovely the world is." "And so this poor Jinni, like a chick struggling to break through its egg, has hopelessly fallen in love with this barren and ravaged world and its circle of life and death. The proud Jinni, once nourished by the delicacies of roses, has fallen for the land infested with toads and vipers..." "It all makes me wonder what it will be like... when the 'raven' becomes the 'groom.'" "So...?" The youngster cowered again. "So, tell me a story, little raven. Let me see the world." The spirit grinned slyly at the sight of the youth's puzzled look, her golden bells tinkling at the end of her braids. And so, the spirit of the moon maiden's city once again embarked on her journey around the world. Footnotes: 1. This is the desert area that the Eremites often refer to as " Dar al-Azif ." This does not refer to a fixed place, since the dunes themselves flow like the wind. 2. Faramaraz, a Purbiruni academic, has insisted on an absurd opinion that this occurred "out of the ignorance inherent to the desert dwellers," which is not even worth refuting. May a hundred birds gather on this unreasonable man's bed, and may the mountains hurl stones at him. 3. Faramaraz, a Purbiruni academic, has argued that the word "rise" was inappropriate here and that a better word should be used to present the image of "pouring out like a radiant cloud of smoke." It must be admitted that his opinion has literary merit, but it will not be adopted academically. May his bowels become as gnarled as stones, and may his barber be the executioner of his hair! 4. Faramaraz, a Purbiruni academic, has pointed out that "Al-Ahmar" was not the name that the monarch used during his lifetime, and that it is improper to quote it here. May wisdom forsake him, may his hair grow thin, and may his beard turn white before its time!

1 Obtained at the start of Vaulting the Wall of Morning Mist . Month: Unknown. Day: Unknown. Weather: Foggy... ...Finally here. Ochkanatlan. This ancient city, now occupied by a violent and evil dragon, and the final resting place of xe2x96x89xe2x96x89... ...If Aunt Liriwu knew, she'd be in quite the huff, that's for sure. But there's no other way. Even if they say I shouldn't take on the regrets of generations past, I still want to finish this... ...Though the Abyss no longer poses as terrifying a threat as it did back when I was born, but whether for the sake of the " Jade of Return " sought by countless adventurers, or to unravel the final riddle of xe2x96x89xe2x96x89, I must go there... ...It's fine, no need to be nervous. You've already had a lot of adventures, right? You're a seasoned adventurer, so it'll all be okay! Not to mention, it's been so long, maybe that nasty dragon has long since vanished... ...Anyway, this is where it starts! My adventure... Page 2 Obtained after defeating the enemies in Palace of the Vision Serpent . Month: Unknown. Day: Unknown. Weather: Rainy... ...Unbelievable, I ended up being attacked by the dragon after all. But maybe I should be thanking it... After all, I wouldn't have stumbled upon this place without it... ...The Core of Chu'ulel . Seems like it was once the heart of the entire city. I heard a member of the tribe speaking about it before, how in ancient times the Sacred Lord once transformed himself into the heart of the dragon city, but I never expected the meaning to be so literal... ...Unlike those I've encountered elsewhere, the Secret Source Automatons here seem to be able to understand speech. Did the Sacred Lord make them in order to protect himself? Anyway, at least I don't have to worry about monsters coming after me for now... ...I can't believe it actually worked. I used the Pyrophosphorite on my body to awaken the dragonspirit slumbering within the heart of the machine... But is this little guy really a dragonspirit? It's so small, and absolutely adorable! And it's green like a chunk of turquoise, so I think I'll call it Cocouik ... ...It's the path to the Altar of Primal Flame . I saw the signs left by Aunt Liriwu, it really is the same path that xe2x96x89xe2x96x89 walked... ...Still, there's only one chunk of Pyrophosphorite left. I must make sure I don't use it up before I get to the Tonatiuh... Page 3 Unlocked by interacting with the Goggles Left Behind by Someone on the Tonatiuh after completion of The Chosen One's Promise . Month: Unknown. Day: Unknown. Weather: Can't tell from where I am now... ...It's completely different from what I imagined. I didn't expect the Tonatiuh to be such a desolate place. I can almost see what the Python King must've felt in those final moments... ...Still, there's Pyrophosphorite everywhere. Does that mean this is the origin of all the Pyrophosphorite that adventurers get? But who could take it from here and give it to them... ...So that's it. It's only thanks to Coco that I now understand the true nature of the "Jade of Return"... ...The machine that could save Natlan, but not us... So many heroes have been sacrificed for this... So why draw us here...? I get it, you can't touch it, can you? That's why you need our hands, need Coco's... ...But even if it's a fake Sacred Grail, it doesn't matter if it's xe2x96x89xe2x96x89, or Aunt Liriwu, anyone who embarks on the journey is a true hero!... ...This is the last fragment of Pyrophosphorite left in the land...
